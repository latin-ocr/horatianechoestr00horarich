ΡΑ leA PHRASE OF SE COND EPODE

Away with dainties like to these 1
He loves the simples of the fields,
Cresses and parsley, corn and peas‚
And all the stores the garden yields,
To garnish cutlets of his lambs,
And slices of his Berkshire hams.

Here, dragging the inverted plough
On drooping necks, his oxen come3
Down from the mountain⁷s sloping brow
His pastured sheep are hurrying home ;
While men and maids of: Celtic race
Crowd round his shining fire-place.

Thus JACOB spoke, and left the street,
Shaking the gold-dust from his feet,
Called in his loans, sold out his stocks‚
And bargained for a rura] box3

But ere a month had passed away,

He found that farming would not pay.
