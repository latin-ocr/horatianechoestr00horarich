206 THE ODES OF HORA CE

To fatten on the tender grass, his sheep the Shepherd

leads
And treads'his rural measures to the music of his

reeds:

The heart of Pan who loves the flocks‚ with tran-
quil pleasure fills

When he hears the dulcet music on Arcadia's
shaded hills.

The season makes us thirsty‚ and, Virgil, if you think
It would not be amiss pure Calenian to drink, —
The client you of noble youths will surely not de-
cline
To pienic with the persumes if I put up the wine.

A little pearl-like box of. nard a buxom cask secures
Which in Sulpician garrets now its precious grace
matures, —-
Potent to dress expanding hopes in colors fresh and
fair,
And efficacious to dilute the bitter cup of care 1

If such delights you fancy, then answer to my call 3
Come, bring along your merchandise, come quieklyvif
at all, —
