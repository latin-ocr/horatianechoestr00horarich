XV. OLD TIMES AND NEW

Jam pauca aratro jugera regz'ae

OON will our regal structures leave small space
Of acres for the ploughshare 3 while we make
Our fish-ponds broader than the Lucrine lake,
And the unmarried plane-tree takes the place

Of vine-wed elms z soon shrubs ancl flowers will blow,
And with a copious fragrance fill the air
From beds of violets and myrtles where

The former master's gainful olives grow 3

Soon will the laurel-trees exclude the rays
Of the too fervid sun. It was not thus
Under the auspices of Romulus,

Or unshorn Cato, in our fathers' days.
