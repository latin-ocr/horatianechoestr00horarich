XII. TO MAECENAS

Nolis longa seroe bella ,Numantioe

SED to soft strains‚ do not command my lyre
To tell of brave N umantians' savage slaughters 3
Nor exploits bold of Hannibal the dire,
Nor Punic blood purpling Sicilian waters 3

Nor of Hylaeus flushed with too much wine 3
Nor how Herculean valor tamed the giant
Sons of the earth, threatening to undermine
Saturn's refulgent house 3 nor the defiant

And cruel Lapithae. In unmeasured lay
You, my Maecenas, shall record the story
Of kings led captive through the Roman Way,
And battles fought and won for Caesar’s glory. ,
