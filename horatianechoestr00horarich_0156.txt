124 THE ODES OF ΗΘΜ CE

Inviolate, I will see the Scythiam river3
Britons, with strangers iamed for savage (leeds 3
Concanians revelling in the blood of steeds;

And the Gelonian with his well-filled quiver.

What pleasures you to lofty Caesar yield,
When, his tired cohorts cantoned in the towns,

Repose in your Pieriam grotto crowns
His toils and triumphs in the battlefield 1

You gentle counsels give, and in the gift
Rejoice. We know the impious revolt
Of the huge Tstans, and the thunderbolt
That on the embattled host fell sure and swift 3

Hurled by the hand of Him whom all obey —
Who o'er the stable earth and stormy sea,
And cities, and the 16311115 of misery,

Rules gods and mortals with impartial sway.

When the young giants in rebellion strove,

In brute force trusting, and with fury wild,

On Pelion's height, leaf-clad Olympus piled‚ --
Great was the horror it inspired in Jove.
