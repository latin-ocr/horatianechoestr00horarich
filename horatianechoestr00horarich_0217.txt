IV. DRUSUS

Qualem ministrum fulminis alitem

IKE a young eagle on the wing,
Armed with the thunderbolt of Jove,
Made by the King of Gods the king
Of all the feathered tribes that rove
The air, —- his guerdon‚ as we read,
For capturing fair Ganymede, —-

First‚ youth and native energy

To untried labors fire his meast, —

A ssight from the maternal nest,-
Next, verna] winds and cloudless days
Invite him to more bold essays 3

And yet a while, and grown more bold,

Abroad by hostile impulse sent,
