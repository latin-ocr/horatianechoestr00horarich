XVI. TO MAECENAS

Inclusam Danaen turris ab‘nea

MPRISONED Danae the brazen tower‚
Its massive oaken doors, the watch-dog’s bark,

Might have protected from the roving spark
Who scales Love’s ramparts at the midnight hour,

If Jove and Venus had not laughed at old
Acrisius, of his maiden charge in sear3
Full well they knew the way was safe and clear

For any god transmuted into gold.

Gold glides through pliant files of sentinels‚
Gold loves to cleave and crush the solid rock 3

More potent than the riving thunder slmek,
The Argive Augur's hapless house it fells.
