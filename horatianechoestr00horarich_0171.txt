AN AMOEBEAN ODE 139

LYDIA

Son of Ornytus, Calais, worthy his sire,

And his Lydia burn with 3 mutual fire 3
Oh, had Ι two lives Ι would give them with joy,
So the fates spare the life of my Thurian boy.

HORACE

But what if our old love should kindle again,

And our lives should be linked in 3 solider chain?
If my golden-haired Chloe were shown to the door,
And the cast-away Lydia queen as before?

LYDIA

Though he were more beauteous and bright than a
star,
Thou light as 3 cork, even lighter by far,
Wert thou stormy and false as the waves of the sea,
With thee I would live, Ι would perish with thee.
