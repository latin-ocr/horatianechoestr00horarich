THE ODES OF HORACE

Loving and lovely all the time
As if false winds had never blown.
Ah, wretched they who win thy smiles
And have not proved thy artful wiles.

With me it is a thing gone by3
In Neptune's temple, on the wall,
A votive tablet tells that I
Have met with storms and baffled all,
And hung my vestments dripping wet -—
A sign, — where they are hanging yet.
