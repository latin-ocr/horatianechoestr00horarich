Angustam amice pauperiem pati

HE hardy youth, whose work in life should be
Sharp warfare 3 who would manage steed and
spean
To strike the savage Parthians with sear,
Must gladly bear with narrow poverty‚

And pass his days beneath the open skies
In perilous deeds. The warring tyrant's wife
And betrothed daughter mark him in the strife‚
From hostile walls, and breathe in blended sighs:

Alas! unused to armies, who can shield
The prineely suitor‚ should he cross the path
Of this fieree lion, and provoke the wrath‚

That‚ red with carnage, scorns the bloody field?
