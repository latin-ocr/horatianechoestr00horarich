VII. TO PLANCUS

Laudabunt alii claram Rhodon

UN—LIGHTED Rhodes, or Mitylene's tmvers,
Or Corinth's walis washed by the double sea,
Ephesus, or Thessalian Tempe's bowers,
Or Thebes, the birthplace of the god of wine,
Or Delphi, famous for Apollo's shrine, —
May win their praise from others, not from me.

Men live who have no work in life beside
Extolling in their never-ending lays

The Athenian city, chaste Minerva's pride,—
While, from all quanters plucked, it is their wont

With olive branches to entwine their front„
Many would honor Juno with the praise

Of rich Mycenae, -- Argos fit for steeds :
Others may love Larissa's fertile field,
