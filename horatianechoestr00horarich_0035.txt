ΙΙ. TO AUGUSTUS

Jam satis terris nivis atque dz’roe

N OUGH of snow and hail has vexed the land
In tempests sent by the Eternal Sire 3

Temples have fallen beneath his red right hand,
While all Rome trembled at the portents dire3

The nations trembled‚ with a panic sear

Lest the times Pyrrha wailed should come again,
And all their many marvels reappear3

Lest Proteus find the mountain-tops the main,

Herding his seals there, and the finny face
Cling to the topmost branches of the trees,
And panting deer the crested waves displace‚
Where the wood-pigeons rezared their colonies.
