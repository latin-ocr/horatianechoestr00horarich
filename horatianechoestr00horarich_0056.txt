THE ODES OF HORACE

What shall I sing before the praise
Due to the Father of our race 3

Who men and gods with justice sways,
Earth in its seasons, time, ancl space?

From whom nought greater springs than He,
The world no like or second bears3

Yet next and near to Deity,
The highest honors Pallas shareS.

Nor will I pass thee by unnamed,
Brave Bacchus, nor the virgin foe

Of savage beasts, nor Phoebus tamed
And feared for his unerring bow.

Alcides too and Leda's twins
Ι 711 sing— the one by chivalry

And one his fame as athlete wins:
When mariners their white star see, —

Drips from the rocks the refluent spray,
The clouds disperse, the winds subside‚

While threatening waves their will obey,
And slumber on the tranquil tide. ⁷
