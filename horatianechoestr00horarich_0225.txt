To APOLLO 193

Wards of Diana, goddess of the bow
Wherewith the stags and lynxes she pursues 3—
Preserve the measures of the Lesbian Muse
And of my verse the cadence and the flow, --

Due songs according to Latona’s son,
Due songs to her whose crescent splendors light
A fruitful harvest and denote the ssight

Of months that in a swift suecession run.

Thou, when a wife, shalt say, “ Ι led the choir
Which at the banquet on Centennial Day,
Versed in his measures, sang the sacred lay

The poet Horace wedded to the lyre.''
