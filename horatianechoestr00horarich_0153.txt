THE JJONEST MAN 121

“ Whither the limits of the world 3113111,
Her arms shall reach‚ and Rome exult to see
Lands where the solar fires hold revelry‚
And lands where clouds prevail‚ and mists and rain.

‘⁴ All earth shall own the Roman's warlike powers,
This law unbroke— that no ancestral pride,
No filial love, whatever may betide‚
Shall reconstruet Troy's tenements and towers.

“ Renaseent Troy shall see the deadly strife
Renewed, and with 3 mournful augury;
While the victorious bands against her Ι

Myself will lead, Jove's sister and his wife.

‘⁴ If 1111133 her barren walls should rise again
By Phoebus' aid, thrice shall they be o'erthrown
By my brave Argives 3 1111133 1113 wife bemoan, —
A weeping captive, — son and husband slain.''

But strain like this no sportive lyre beseems 3
Whither dost tend, rash Muse? Prsthee, 3111 short
The attempt Olympian speeehes to report‚

Nor by light measures lessen mighty themeS.
