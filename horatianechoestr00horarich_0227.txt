To TORQUA TUS 19 5

The seasons' losses the swift moons repair 3

But when we die and go where go we must, —
AEneaS, Ancus, powerful Tullus, there,

Shall weleome us : — alas, but 51136165 and dust 1

Who knows if Heaven that tenders us To-day
Will to our sum of life To-morrow spare ?

All that with liberal mind you give away
Escapes the greedy clutches of your heir.

When once you join the legions gone before,
And Minos utters his supreme decree,

Nothing, Torquatus, can your life restore, —-
Nor birth, nor eloquence, nor piety.

In durance, chaste Hippolytus remains, -
Diana could not free him from the 'shades;

To burst asunder dear Pirithous' chains,
Theseus in vain Lethean realms invades.
