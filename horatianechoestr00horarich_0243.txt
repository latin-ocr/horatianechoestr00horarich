XV. THE PRAISES OF AUGUSTUS

Plzoehus volentem proelia me loqui

N siege and battlefield I mused‚
Of martial themes I wished to sing,
But Phoebus chid -my lyre refused
To speak, and mute was every string 3
He bade me furl my little sails‚
Nor rashly tempt Tyrrheniam gales.

’T is thine‚ O Caesar, to restore
To wasted fields their wealth of corn 3
And standards that we lost of yore, —
From haughty Parthia's columns torn, ——
Bring back in triumph to our shrine—-
Of Jupiter Capitoline.

Beneath thy sway we live in peace,

The double gates of Janus close,
