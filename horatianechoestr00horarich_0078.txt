46 THE ODES OF ΗΘΚΛ CE

Even didst thou touch the lyre more cunningly
Than Thracian Orpheus, and by magic song
Compel the trees to hear, —if Mercury
Has once impaled him in the dusky throng

By his dire wand, he will not heed thy prayer
And animate again the bloodless shapej,

Hard fate 1 but Nature teaches us to bear
The ills we cannot conquer or escape.
