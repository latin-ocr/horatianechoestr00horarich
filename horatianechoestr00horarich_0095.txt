TO ΕΘΚ TUNE 6 3

Fear, lest with ruin thou shouldst overvvhelm
And erush the standing pillar of the State 3
Lest foes to arms, by fervor of debate‚

Be roused to arms, and break the imperial realm.

Before thee, prompt to do thy Stern command,
Stalks dire Necessity in thy service bred,
With grappling-hooks and store of molten lead,
And spikes and wedges in her brazen hand.

Thee Hope attends ε thee, clad in garb of white,
Her fellow‚ rarely-met Fidelity 3—
And if, thy garments changed, in hate thou fiee
From powerful houses, —follows in thy ssight.

The faithless vulgar and the courtesan
Forsworn retire 3 and when the casks are dry—
Drained to the dregs — fair-weather comrades fly,
Eager to shun the unprosperous while they can.

To Caesar, bound for Britain’s savage Isles --
Earth's Western limit‚ —give protecting care3
On levied hosts who terror Eastward bear

To the Red Sea, bestow thy favoring smiles.
