148 THE ODES OF HORACE

This clay —- indeed a festal day to me —
Shall banish cares z Ι have no sear for life
From foreign warfare or domestic strife‚

While Caesar reigns supreme by land and sea.

Go, boy, and wreaths and persumes bring to us
And wine, that recollects the Marsian war, —-
If it so happen that a single jar

Escaped the raid of roving Spartacus ε

And bid sweet-voiced Neaera not delay
Her perfumed tresses in a knot to tie, —-
And if the surly janitor deny

His mistress, wrangle not but come away.

This might have angerecl me in my hot years
When Plancus was our consul, not to-day3
For passions slacken as our loeks grow gray,

And in love's tiffs and frays no fire appears.
