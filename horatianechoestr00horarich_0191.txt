To ΗΠΒ YLE 159

The peaceful herd unconscious roams,
Whose blood the pontiff's axe shall stain ς

For due oblations of the State

A people's crimes must expiate.

The sacred temple's public shrine
Demands a slaughtered hecatomb‚
But such is not for thee 01· ‘chine 3
The little gods that guard thy home
Desire no costlier gifts from thee
Than myrtle wreaths ancl rosemary.

No Ξ let thy hand the altar touch,
' Empty of gists, unstained by gusst, ——
A grateful heart avails as much

As if a victim's blood were spilt;
Thou with the Gods thy peace shalt make
With crackling salt and pious cake.
