ΗΘΚΛ CE xxi

The Julian star ascends the sky,
It'shines on groups of learned men,
Law clips the wings of Liberty‚
And Horace wields the Empire’s pen.

Names, only names Ξ —the brilliant throng
That crowd the poet's pictured page :
Still lives in his imperial song

The soul of the Augustan age.

No longer through the Sacred Way
The pontiffs lead the vestal train 3

T hrones crumble, dynasties decay,
Of Alaric born, or Charlemagne —

SaintS‚ SoldierS‚ PresbyterS, and Popes
In legions rise and disappear,

And Bards with glowing horoscopes
Oblivion garners year by year:

But on strong wing, through upper air, —
Two worlds beneath, the Old and N ew, —-
The Roman Swan is wasted where

The Roman eagles never flew. J O S
