XXXV. TO FORTUNE
O diva, gratum quae regis Antium

GODDESS‚ queen of Antium’s fair domains‚
A present power in morta] destinies‚
Bidding to lofty heights the lowly rise‚
And changing triumphs to funereal trains ε

The humble tiller of the soil to thee,
Solicitous‚ his earnest prayer prefers ;
Thine aid invoking‚ suppliant mariners

Cleave with Bithynian keel the Cretan sea.

Homage to thee cities and nations pay3
Nomadic Scythians and Dacians rude,
Mothers of savage kings, fierce Latium’s brood,

And purple-vested tyrants sear thy sway :
