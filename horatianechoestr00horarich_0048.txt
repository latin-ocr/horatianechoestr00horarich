16 THE ODES OF HORACE

Or Lacedaemon with her patient deeds 3
To me Albunea's resounding cave,

The groves, the orchards Tibur's rivers lave,
And Anio‘s falls, a keener pleasure yield.

As the white South wind often clears the skies
From cloud and mist, nor brings perpetual show-
ers, —
Thus you, my Plancus, by experienee wise‚
N either at sorrows nor at toils repine‚
But soothe their bitterness with mellow wine,
Abridge life's cares, prolong its joyous hours, —

Whether the camp with its superb array
Of standards keep you still —or to the shade

Of your own Tibur you are on the way.
When from his sire and Salamis Teucer fied,

With poplar wreaths they say he crowned his head.
And his friends’ fears With cheering words allayed :

“ Where fortune leads us, than my sire more kind,

Thither, my friends and comrades‚ let us ge, —-
In other lands a better home to find.

Despair of nought with Teucer as your guide 32
Hopes under Teucer's auspices abide

While the waves float us and the breezes blow.
