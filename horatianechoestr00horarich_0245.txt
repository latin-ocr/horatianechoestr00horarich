THE PRAJSES OF AUGUSTUS 213

These themes Ι leave ; the lot be mine
On common and on festal days,

With Bacchus’ gifts of fiowers and wine
To mingle my congenial lays, —

And while our wives and children share

In offerings of praise and prayer,

We Ἢ, like our fatherS, celebrate, —

In songs that blend with Lydian pipeS‚ —
The men in simple virtues great,

Our captains of the ancient types 3
Anchises, Troy - our themes shall be,
And genia] Venus' progeny.
