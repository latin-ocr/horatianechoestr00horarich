THE ODES OF HORACE·

Even now the downy plumes begin
F ingers and shoulders to invade 3

To 3 white bird transfigured I

Am ready to essay the sky.

On swifter than Icarian wing
Ι hover where the Bosphorus roars,
And my eanorous note shall ring
Along Gaetulia's buming shores,
And pierce the Hyperborean plains
Where 311 eternal winter reigns.

Me— shall remote Gelonians know,

And Parthians, who disguise the sear
With which they face their Roman foe, —
My song the Colchians shall hear —
Some time to learned Spaniards known,
And to the men who drink the Rhone.

Away — all notes of hireling woe!
All trappings of funereal gloom —
The clamorous dirge, the ghastly show —
There is no tenant of my tomb:
Superfluous are the honors spent
Above 311 empty monument.
