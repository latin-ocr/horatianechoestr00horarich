68 THE ODES OF HORACE

But her rage by Roman fires was tanoed,
That left of her fleets but 3 single sail,

And the cheek which the Mareot grape inflamed‚
When Caesar followed her ssight, grew pale.

'shrough the waters swiftly his mariners row,

Α5 the hawk sweeps down on the doves in the air,
Or through fields of Haemonia white with snow

The hunter chases the timorous hare.

He brought for the deadly monster chains, —-
She will not stoop to 3 fate abhorred3

No coward blood in her woman's velus,
She seeks no haven and {ears no sword.

Her falling palace she treads 3 Queen,

And bravely her crumbling sceptro grasps 3
With 3 soul unmoved and 3 face serene

She bares her breast to the fatal asps.

The hunt of the savage Illyrians is vain 3
A conqueror’s triumph she scorns to grace ——

But fronts her fate with 3 fierce disdain,
And dies, the last of 3 royal race.
