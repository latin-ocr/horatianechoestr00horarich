TO A UGCSTL'S 5

Or wilt thou, Erycine, assume the task,
Smiling With Mirth and Cupid in thy train?

Or thee, great Founder, shall we humbly ask
To care for thy neglected sons again, —

Thee who enjoy’st the battle's din and show,
Whom clashing arms and shining helms denght,
And the fierce aspect, glaring on his foe,
Of Marsian soldier in the bloody fight?

Or wilt thou, leaving thy celestial sphere,
Of mortal youth the figure imitate,

Thou, gentle Maia's winged son, appear, —
Caesar's avenger, saviour of the State?

Late mayst thou seek again thy native skies‚
Long with the people of Quirinus stay3

And never may untimely blast arise
To bear thee, wearied with our crimes, away.

Accept the names of Prince and Father here7
Here the proud triumph and the glad ovation :
No Parthian inroads unavenged we sear,
while thou, great Caesar, guide and guard the
nation.
