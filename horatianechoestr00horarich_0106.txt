74 THE ODES OF HORACE

Greed, sels-indulgent, like the dropsy, grows,
Its thirst unslakod ; and while the cause remains
Of dire disease, nor flies the poisoned veins,
Through the pale {rame the watery languor flows.

Phraates to the throne of Persian kings
Restored —- dissenting Virtue strikes his name
From those deemed happy by the world's acchim,
Unteaching the false names men give to things.

The diadem and a sure empire bring,
And deathless bays -- to him who passos by
Huge heaps of gold, and with no longing eye
Looks back upon them ,- —— he alone is king.
