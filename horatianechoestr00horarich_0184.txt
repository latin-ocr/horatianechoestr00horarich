XVII. TO LAMIA
AEli vetusto nobilis ab Lamo

LIUS of ancient Lamus’ noble race, —
(Root of the famous genealogie tree
Whose branches spread so in our history,
To which all Lamias their lineage trace 3

From that original no doubt you spring, —
Lamus who built the walls of Formia,
And, where the waves of Liris wash away
Marica’s banks, reigned far and wide the king :)

To-morrow⁷s Eastern storm‚ of many leaves
Shall strip the grove, and worthless sea-weed strow
On barren shores - unless the long-lived crow

With augury of coming rain deceives ;
