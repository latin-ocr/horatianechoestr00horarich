THE ODES OF HORACE

But THEE, immersed in state affairs,
Our city's perils overwhelm ——

Thy {ears the furthest Orient shares,
With Bactra, Cyrus' ancient realm—

And the wild race that bivouacs on
The raided borders of the Don.

The time to come God wisely shrouds
From mortal eyes in darkest night,

And smiles when man would pierce the clouds
And bring His hidden ways to light:

Seek not the future — study how

To make the most and best of Now.

For Life is like the river's tide,
Whose waters now mid-channel keep,
And on a glassy surfaee glide
Serenely to the Tuscan deep—-
But when a raging deluge fills
And overflows the quiet rills —

Houses‚ uprooted trees, and fiocks

Are swept together from the shores, —
Through piles of water-eaten rocks

With clamorous din the torrent roars, ——-
