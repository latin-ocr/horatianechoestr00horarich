VIII. TO MAECENAS

Martiis coelebs quid agam K alendis

OU wonder what it means, a bachelor
Should keep the Matron's feast day‚—and
inquire
What all these censers and these flowers are for, --
This incense, this turs altar, and its fire, —

You, with all lore of either language filled Ξ
Ι vowed the day to Bacchus to devote,
(When by the falling tree so nearly killed)
And spread a feast for him and slay a goat.

In each recurring year, this festal day
The pitch from the astricted eorl< shall strip,
And pierce a cask, in garret stowed away

To drink the smoke‚ in Tullus' consulship.
