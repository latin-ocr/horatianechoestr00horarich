He swoops upon the shepherd {old 3
But now, on feast and fight intent,

He seizes serpente in their lair,

And wrestles with them in the air:

Thus Drusus waging war, they saw, —
The mountaineer Vindelici, —

In Rhoetian Aips (but whence they draw
The custom immemorially

Of carrying in their attacks

The Amazonian battle-axe

On their right arms, Ι ’11 not enquire, —
For all things one ought not to kn0w):

But when by youth's address and fire
The conquerors of long ago

Are beaten in their turn, and feel

The force of his victorious steel, —

Thus bravely overthrown they find
What nurture adds to nature's gifts 3

That discipline, of heart and mind
Alike, to nobles manhood lifts3

And heights to which the Netos grow

The training of Augustus show.
