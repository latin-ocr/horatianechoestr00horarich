2 16 APPENDIX

All the early manuscripts and all the early editions have
‘me.’ The ‘te’ is purely conjectural, without any writ-
ten authority, resting entirely on the taste and judgment
that are used in looking out the true lection. In under-
taking to determine the true reading, we inquire first what
is the purpose of the Ode. It is a dedication. In the fol-
lowing analysis, using the proposed emendation, there
seems to be sequence and congruity : —-

Men have divers tastes, and some win the prizes that make of
great masters gods, — one in racing, others in politics, speculat-
ing, agriculture, commerce, war, hunting. Your taste is for
letters in which you have won ivies that entitle you to mix with
the celestial gods. I am a poet, and while the muses aid me I
am removed from the common crowd and haunt the cool groves
with the satyrs and nymphs, the semi-deities. But if you, my
patron, who are a competent judge, rank me among the lyric
poets, I shall be so proud as to hit the stars with my head.

Here there is no difficulty or confusion. But, in the first
place, the old reading makes, as the commentators admit,
a repetition of the same idea with variations. And then it
makes the dedication a glorification of the writer himself.
He loses sight of his patron altogether and bursts out into
a rhapsody of sels-praise. Is it reasonable to suppose that
a devoted friend and a man of sense would be guilty of
such gaucherz‘e? We have ‘me’—-‘me’-—‘me’—all in
the last eight lines. Is it possible that in the conclusion .
and climax of such an Ode it should be all egotism,—
‘me' in the beginning, ‘me ’ in the middle, and ‘me’ and
‘ I ’ in the end? It reminds one of a more pardonable ego-
tism in the line of the AEneid—

Me, me, adsum, qui feci, in me convertite ferrum.1
