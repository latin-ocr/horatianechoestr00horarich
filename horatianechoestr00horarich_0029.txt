E who would echo Horace' lays
Aspires to an Iearian fame ;
And borne on waxen wings essays
A ssight — may give some sea 3 name.

My fate perchance! But 35 Ι write
I see through Time's reverted glass‚
In fleckered mists of shade and light,
The phantoms of the ages pass.

Ι 566 an infant, tired with play,
Sleep sweetly in Apulia's wild,
And doves bring myrtle leaves and bay

To cover the courageous child.
