XXVII. TO GALATEA

Impios parrae recinentis omen

LL-OMENED‚ let a tawny fox,
A bitch with whelps‚ a screeching jay,
Or gray wolf from Lanuvian rocks,
Lead wicked travellers on their way.

And if they make a lucky start

With happy omens, -— may a snake
Athwart the road like arrow dart,

And frightened nags the journey break.

A watchful augur, Ι, at least
When my friend's safety wakes my fears,
Invoke the raven from the East

Ere the storm-boding bird appears.
