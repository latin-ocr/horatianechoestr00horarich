TO THALJARCHUS

The future never seek to learn 3
Count every sort of day a gain,
Nor dulcet loves nor danees spurn

While youth and youth's desires remain.

And never, till your hair is white,
Fly from the favors of the fair â€”
The gentle whispers heard at night,
The trysting-place of park or square,

When, by her merry laugh betrayed,
She half consents and half resists,

While you enfold the hiding maid,
And rob her finger and her wrists,
