XI. To LEUCONOE

Tu ne quaesieris, scire nefas

H, do not seek to learn, Leuconoe,
What fate the Gods reserve for you or me3

'T is wrong. Nor call in Babylonian seers
By mystic numbers to forecast your years.
Better endure what Jupiter ordains,
And not inquire how much of life remains;
Perhaps more winters — this our last may be,
Grinding the rocks that curb the Tyrrhene sea.
F ilter your wine, be wise, there 's little scope
In a short life to cherish distant hope.
Even while we speak‚ Time envious slips away 3

Incredulous of the morrow, — pluck to·day !
