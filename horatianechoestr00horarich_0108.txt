76 THE ODES OF ΗΘΚΛ CE

Bring hither wines‚ perfumes, and, sweetest of fiowers‚

The rose, —though so fleeting it blooms but to
wither 3

While the F ates spare your life, make the most of its

hours 3
With youth, health‚ and. riches‚ O haste to corne

hither.

Your seat on the Tiber‚ your pleasant domains,
The home and the garden, your joy and your care,
You must leave ,them and lose thern, in spite of your
pains 3
You have only been heaping 3 pile for your heir.

Whether scion of Inachus, oldest of kings‚

Or the child of 3 pauper, he draws his first breath‚ —
It matters to none whence his lineage springs,

All, all are the victims of pitiless death.

To the same place are bound all the children of men,
Our lots are 311 shaken in one common urn3

Al] are drawn from it, sooner or later, and then
We embark on the voyage whence we never return.
