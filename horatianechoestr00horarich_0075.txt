TO MJSCUS

Portentous monster 1 Daunia

The warlike never bred a worse 3
None such in her oak-forests prey,
And none in Mauritania,

The lions' arid nurse.

Place me in regions where no tree
Is ever fanned by summer air,
The side of earth that nebulae

And fogs infest perpetually,
And make a desert there :

Or in the torrid atmosphere

Where human dwelling may not he,

The sun impels his car so near, —
Ι ’11 dote on my sweet-smiling dear,

Sweet-prattling Lalage.
