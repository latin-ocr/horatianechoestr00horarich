obliged to diminish the claim of the poet. ‘ Horace
n’intend j0uir du commerce des dieux que sur la terre, ce
qui s'explique par les vers suivants, —c'est dans les forets
qu’il assiste aux danses des nymphes et des satyres‚ etc.,
— mais pour monter lui-meme aux demeures celestes, il a

Page, 1883, after saying ‘N otice the pronoun me put

in verses 6, 30, and 36 is somewhat awkward.’ He does
not appreciate Orelli's attempt to distinguish them.

Coming now to the authority for the emendation, we find
the conjecture ascribed to Dr. Francis Hare, a critic of
great learning and penetration,—successively Bishop of
St. Asaph (1727), and Chichester (1731). In his verse
translation of the Odes, he gives the passage thus: -

The wreath on learned brows bestowed,

He says, ‘Without Te there is no notice of Maecenas.
There is extravagant exaltation of sels and no compliment
to his patron. There is an abs-urd fall from heaven to
earth. These are faults Horace would not be guilty of.
The· reading is fully agreeable to the whole design and
meaning of the Ode. There is in it an imitation of an ode
of Pindar in which the same antitheses are observed all
through. Pindar concludes with an antithesis between
himself and Hieron, king of Syracuse: -—

Thine be the glory and the grace
To shine and conquer in the race ἔ
