XXXII. TO MY LYRE

Poscimur. Si quid vacui sub umbra

E are called on : if ever, reclined in the shade,
Joy touching thy stringe, some light carol Ι ’ve
playecL
Which for one or more seasons its life may prolong,
Come, sing me, my Lyre, a good Latin song.

Alcaeus of Lesbos attuned thee of old,
The loyal in love, and in battle the bold,
But the poet at all times‚—though wielding the
brand,

Or mooring his suff-beaten boat to the strand.

Thy silves-toned chords with his symphonies rang 3
Of the Muses and Bacchus and Venus he sang,
Of the boy by her side — he is clinging there yet, ——

And of Lycus with eyes and hair blaek as the je't.
