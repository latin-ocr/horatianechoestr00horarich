200 THE ODES OF HORACE

Helen of Lacedaemon not alone
Has lusted for a paramour's smooth tresseS‚

Enamored of the gold-inwoven dresses,
The retinue and splendor of a throne.

Troy more than once was vexed3 from bow of Crete
Teucer was not the first his shafts to aim,
Nor Sthenelus the first to conquer fame,

Nor grand Idomeneus by martial teat 3

But the Muse told their story. Not the brave
Deiphobus, and not the fiery Hector,
Of modest wives and children the protector,
Was first with thousand wounds to find a grave.

Of valiant men a countless multitude
Lived before Agamemnon —yet none weep
Their fate 3 no sacred bard disturbs their sleep,
And night's long, silent shadows o'er them brood.

Valor unsung, unknown, from obscure sloth
Differs but little 3 should Ι silent be,
Nor on my page the tribute render thee

Due thy deserts, 't were grievous wrong to both.
