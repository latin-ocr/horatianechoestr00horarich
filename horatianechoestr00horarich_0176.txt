144 THE ODES OF HORACE

One only, famed in every age,
Worthy the nuptial torch and vows,
Braving a perjured father’s rage,

Was nobly false and saved her spouse.

“ Rise up Ξ ” she to her husband said,
“ Rise up, lest the long sleep befall, —
From those thou hadst no cause to dread—
Our father and our sisters all,

“Who, as a lioness her prey,
Each would a victim rend3 but I
Will prove more merciful than they,
Nor shalt thou captured be or die.

“Me shall a father load with chains,
For merey to a husband shown3
An exile to Numidian phtius,
His fleet shall carry me alone.

“ Fly while thou canst by land 01· wave,
While night and Venus favor thee3
And on my sepulchre engrave
Some tribute to my mem01·y.’'
