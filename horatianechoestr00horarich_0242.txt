210 THE ODES OF HORACE

But thou the plans and forces didst provide,
And thine the favoring gods, for on the day
Abandoned Alexandria suppliant lay,

And ports and empty palaee opened wide,

Propitious Fortune once more crowned thy arms
In the third lustrum 3 and to thy commands,
For victories achieved in other lands,

Awards renewing honors and fresh palms.

Till now untamed Cantabrians honor thee —
Indians and nomad Scythians and the Medes -—-
Whither our standards fly thy fame precedes,

Guard of Imperial Rome and Italy.

Thee doth the Danube, and mysterious Nile
That hides its springs, obey 3 swift Tigris, thee 3
Thine appanage the monster-bearing sea

That rages round the Briton's distant isle ἔ

Gallia, that faces death without a sear,
Iberia, that our arms so long withstood,
And the Sygambri who delight in blood —“
Their weapons east aside - thy name revere!
