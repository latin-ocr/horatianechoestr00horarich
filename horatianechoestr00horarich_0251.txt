APPENDJX 219

this day as the most learned of British critics and commen-
tators. Alexander Cunningham, the critic of Bentley,
suggests fifteen conJectureS, and other editors have taken
their turn at guessing what Horace might have said—if
he had been of their way of thinking— from the scholiasts
down to Macleane and Wickham. True it is that Mac-
leane says, in somewhat slovenly English, ‘I have in no

however, is not an accurate statement, for he not only
accepts conjectural readings, but distinctly points them
out as conjectural. Ι think the weight of authority is that
a conJectural reading is clearly admissible, even against
all the texts, if it is so fortified that there is no reasonable
doubt of its accuracy.

Now let us dissect the original and ascertain the abso-

the god in their dances and processions. The ivy was
sacred to Bacchus, and it seems to have been employed in
making victorious wreaths for all manner of men and
women distinguished for any accomplishment. It was

Melpomene, in the closing Ode of the third book, he begs
her to crown him with the Delphic laurel. The laurel was
the meed of the patriot‚ bought by his blood on the field of
