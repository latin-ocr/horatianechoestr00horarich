To BARJA'E 8 7

This Venus laughs at, not alone,—
Her simple nymphs laugh all the same, —
While Cupid on a blood—dyed stone
Sharpens his arrows tipped with flame.

And While the Roman youth increase,
New slaves grow up to wear thy chain7
And never will old lovers cease
To quit thee and come back again.

Frugal old men and mothers dread
The wiles that lure their boys astray‚
And brides are fearful, newly wed,
Thou 'lt steal their husbands' hearts away.
