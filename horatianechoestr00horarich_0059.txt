XIII. TO LYDIA
Cum tlt, Lydia, Telephi

OW it is Telephus' rosy neck,
Then it is Telephus’ waxen arms 3
While you, my Lydia, little reck
How my heart swells as you praise his charms.

My wavering mind from its centre flies,
Quick is my color to come and go,

The tear-drops furtively dim my eyes,
And with inward fires how thin I grow!

I burn when Ι see on your shoulders white
That the reveller's wine has left a stain,
Or behold the kiss of the frenzied wight
In the print of his tooth which your lips retain.
