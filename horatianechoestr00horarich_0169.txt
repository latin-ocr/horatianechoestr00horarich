To MAECENAS 137

A hundred cupSâ€š Maecenas, for your friend,
Drink to his safety. With the morning light,

The lamps still burning, shall our session end 3
Far hence all anger and all noise to-night.

Touching the State dismiss all anxious care 3
Slain are the troops of Dacian Cotis03

In civil broils the Parthians prepare
To bring upon themselves a weight of woe 3

Now the Cantabrian of the Spanish coast,
Our ancient foe, the first time wears our chains3
And now with bow unstrung the Scythiam host
Retreating lingers on the harried plains.

You for the public weal need have no sear,

So do not worry with your own affairs 3
Enjoy the pleasures that await you here

And for the present hour take leave of cares.
