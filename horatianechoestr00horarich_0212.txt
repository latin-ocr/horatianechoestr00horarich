T HE ODES OF HORA CE

Or sings of gods and monarchs who
The blood of gods as heroes claim,
Who in just rage the Centaurs slew
And quenched the fell Chimaera’s flame 3

Or thern the Elean palm uplifts

To feel like gods —the men who vie
In ring or race, and win the gifts

A hundred statues would not buy 3

Or to the stars exalts some youth,
Snatched from a weeping bride away,

Whose strength and sense and golden truth
Shall live forever in his lay.

The Theban swan affects the sky,
And, wafted on the swelling breeze‚
Soars through the clouds— but, Antony‚
Like one of Mount Matina's bees

That roams in patient quest of flowers
Tibur's moist banks and groves along,
So I consume laborious hours
In fashioning my little song. .
