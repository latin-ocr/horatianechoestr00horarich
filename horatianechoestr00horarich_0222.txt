THE ODES OF HORACE

Perished ! the glories of our name, —-
Perished 1 all hope of future fame.’'

There ’s nothing mortal that withstands
‘The prowess of the Claudian race,

For Jove himself upholds their hands
And clothes them with benignant grace,

While they, by care and counsel wise‚

Above war’s pangs and perils rise.
