VIII. TO CENSORINUS

Donarem pateras grataque commodus

ASES and bowls of bronze Ι would bestow
On friends beloved and cherished, one and all,
And, Censorinus, you must surely know
That not to you my poorest gifts would fall.

I would give freely Grecian tripods‚ such
As stalwarts won in Pythian gamos well fought, —-
Pictures with hues that show Parrhasius' touch,
Statues of men and gods by Scopas wrought ε

Such is my will, and such my way would be
If I were rich in works of art like these 3
You do not lael< them, and your mind is free

To find in other arts the power to please.
