They till their acres, without metes or bounds‚
Permitting the new-comer

To crop his corn and fruits on the same grounds3

The blameless matron cares

For her step-children with a mother’s love 3
The dowered wife forbears

To trust a lover, or her lord reprove.

That dower, her sole estate,
Is the ancestral virtue, Chastity‚
Ever inviolate 3
A fault is sin 3 sin's weges is to die.

Oh 1 who will make his aim,

By quelling impious feuds and civic rage,
To carve the deathless name

Of Father of his Country on the age?

Wild license dare to tame,
Dear to posterity ! Alas, our crime !
To envy living fame, “
And praise the virtues of an elder time,
