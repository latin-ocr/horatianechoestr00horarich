ΙΙΙ. ΤΟ DELLIUS

AEqztam memento rebus in arduis

HEN the outlook is dark and your star on the
wane, ·

Take care that your mind never loses its poise3
And when Fortune‚ my Dellius, smiles brightly again,
With the same equanimity temper your joys.

For your goa] is the grave, run your raoe as you may, —
Whether always dejected you toil and repine,
Or on feast-days in grassy nook moisten your clay
. With a bottle of choico old Falernian wine.

Where the silver-leaved poplar and towering pine,
With boughs interlaced‚ to their shadows invite 3
Where the brool< cuts the turs in a tortuous line,
And flashes and frets in its tremulous fiight3
