ΙΙ. ΤΟ JULIUS ANTONIUS

Pindarum quisquis studet oemularz’

E who would walk in Pindar's ways
Strives for a Daedalean fame3
And on his wings of wax essays
To give some glassy sea a name.

Like mountain stream that swollen by showers
From bank and barrier bursts away,
Sublime and deep, -- so Pindar pours
The torrent of his fervid lay.

To him, audaeious bard, assign
Apollo's laurel, —whether he
Dashes in dithyrambic line,
Rolling new words in numbers free 3
