I. TO VENUS

Intermissa, Venus, diu

ARS long suspended Why renew?
O spare me, Venus, spare, Ι prayl
Indeed I ’m not the man that knew
The gentle Cinara’s queenly sway.

Mother severe of sweet desires!
Verging on fifty years, Ι 'm slow
And hard to melt with amorous fires z
Where youth’s bland prayers recall thee, -==—= Go 1

And if thou seek a fitting beart,
A timely one to kindle thus, —
Hence with thy shining swans depart

And dwell with Paulus Maximus.
