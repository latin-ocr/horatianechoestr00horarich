TO A TREE 95

To my fields, — with the evil intent at the time
That thou some day shouldst fall on thy innocent
master.

As to what we should shun we are all in the dark, -
Every hour that passes is fraught with its danger;
But the marines sailing in Tyrian bark

Dreads ‘the sea‚-—-and to all other dread is a
stranger3

The soldier fears war and the cloud in the air
Of arrows the Parthian shoots in his flying3

The Parthian {ears dungeons: but none are aware
How the summons will come that admits no denying.

How near have I come to the Kingdom of Night
Where AEacus is judge and Proserpina reigning,
With the separate seats of the happy in sight,
Where flits Sappho’s ghost‚ with her lyre, complain-

ing

Of the Lesbian girls; and where wanders the bard,
Alcaeus, whose harp wakes a deeper emoffion,

As he strikes it with golden bow, —- singing how hard
Are the evils of exsse, of war, and the ocean 1
