THE ODES OF HORACE

Noble among the forest's daughters.
In painted Sterns no crews confideÍ¾

And thom take heed, lest Winds ancl waters
Should make a mocking of thy pride.

Of late, the cause of sad repining 3
Now, of fond hope and weighty care z
But where the Cyclades are shining,
Of storms and hidden rocks beware!
