Α CHORUS OF VlRGlNS AND YOUTHS 115

The affluent lord, fastidious of dry land,
Aids the contractors' workmen with his slaves,
And, crowding fishes in their native waves,
Sinks rock and rubble where his house may stand.

But fears and sad forebodings of the mind
Scale where the master mounts 3 Care never quits

The brazen galley3 where the rider sits,
On the same saddle black Care rides behind.

If Phrygian marbles cannot soothe our grief,
Nor garments that with purple lustre shine,
Nor the rich juice of the Falernian vine,

Nor Achaemenian perfumes bring relies ;

Say why a modern palace should I mise,

With pillars envied of the passers·by,

Or change my Sabine Valley —tell me, why?
For wealth that only brings more> anxious days.
