TO JULJUS ANTONIUS

But you shall strike with larger quill
The lyre that sounds with Caesar's praise‚
When he ascends the sacred hill,
Sygambria’s victor, crowned with bays:

No better, greater gift, have F ate
And the good Gods bestowed on earth
Nor will, though they should re-create
The times that saw its golden birth.

And you shall sing, in lofty vstrain‚
Of festive days and public sports
For brave Augustus come again —
Of crowded streets and empty Courts.

With you I then will lift my voice —-

Should words worth hearing come from me 3

In Caesar's welcome all rejoice 3
O radiant Sun 1 All praise to thee Ξ

And as we follow in your train,
Io Triumphe ἔ we will sing3
Again we 'll sing it and again,
And to kind Gods our incense bring.
