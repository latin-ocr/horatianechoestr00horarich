78 THE ODES OF HORA CE

The gods are cruel 3 it may be

Fair Phyllis' lineage shows no flaw, —-
Of royal blood a princess she, —

And you a royal son-in·law.

From no plebeian rubbish came,
Believe me, one to you so dear,
No mother of ignoble fame
Bore one so liberal and sincere.

Her arms and face and founded leg,
Heart-whole Ι praise 3 dis-‚miss your fears,

Nor harbor idle doubts, Ι beg,
Of one hard on to forty years.
