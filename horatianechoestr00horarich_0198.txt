166 THE ODES OF ΗΘΚΛ CE

May neither woodpecker nor crow
Rode, Galatea, harm to thee3

Be happy, wheresoe'er thou go,
And while thou live, remember me.

Behold in what a boisterous blow
Orion sinks. The Hadrian bay

When black with clouds too well I know,
And how the white West winds betray.

Let wives and sons ot' enemies

T hrill with the rising South—wind’s mar,
When seas reflect the darkened skies

And surges lash the trembling shore.

Europa brave, her snow-white form
Entrusted to the faithless bull,

Grew pale at the i‘mpending storm
And the deep sea of monsters full.

She who in meadows found delight
And wove for Nymphs the votive wreath‚
’ Saw nought‚ when fell the dusky night,
But stass above and waves beneath.
