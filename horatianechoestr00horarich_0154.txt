IV. TO CALLIOPE

Descende eoelo et die age tibia

ESCEND from heaven and a long lay inspire,
My queen, Calliope — whether thy choice
Be for the pipe with a clear ringing voice,
Or thou prefer the chords of Phoebus' lyre.

Hear you ? or does a charming phantasy
Delude me? for I seem to hear — and stray
Through sacred groves where genia] breezes play,
And running waters murmur pleasantly.

When lost on Vultur, the Apulian Steep,
Wandering beyond my own Apulia,
The doves brought leaves to screen me where Ι lay —

Thus ran the legend -- wearied and asleep.
