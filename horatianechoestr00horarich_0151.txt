THE HOA'ES T MA Α* I 19

The meod deservimg, father Bacchus, thus
The untamed tigers bore thee to the stars,
Wearing the yoke3 and thus the steeds of Mars
From Acherontine realms bore Romulus :

What time the gods, in council met, applaud
The words of Juno heard so gratefully3
“ Troy! Troy! to chaste Minerva and to me
Doomed —from the time Laomedon by fraud

“ Kept from the builder Gods their just reward ς
Her towers have fallen and crumbled in the dust ;
By a strange woman and false umpire’s lust
Doomed —xvith her faithless race ancl faithless lord.

“ Superb, the treacherous guest no longer shines
For the Lacoenian adusteress,

Nor does the perjured house of Priam press,

With Hector's might, the gallant Argivo lineS.

“ The war has ceased our discords made so long, —
My anger with it 3 I will now restore
My grandson, whom our Trojan priestess bore,
To Mars, unmindful of my hate and wrong.
