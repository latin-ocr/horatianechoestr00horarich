when he was a schoolboy, he had given more and
more thought with advancing years, and the transla-
tions contained in this volume were made, at odd
times and as a recreation, during the last decade of
his life. At one time he contemplated publishing a
collection of the best translations ot the Odes. He
collected a large number of books for this purpose,
and left notes and criticisms on the versions of the
various English translatorsâ€š from Sir Philip Sidney to
Sir Theodore Martin. To encourage in his college
the love of the poet, he offered, in 1886, a prize for the
best metrical translation of an ode of Horace, which
he continued annually during his life, and which has
since been endowed by his daughter. It was the first
prize opened to the competition of the Annex studentS.

Always interested in the welfare of his Alma Mater,
he was instrumental in starting the movement that
resulted in the broadening of the ranks of the Over-
seers by allowing them to be chosen from any State
in the Union, and, in 1880, he followed Dr. Bellows as
the second Overseer elected outside of MassachusettS.
He was for several years President of the Harvard
Club of New York, in which city he resided after his
return from Europe.
