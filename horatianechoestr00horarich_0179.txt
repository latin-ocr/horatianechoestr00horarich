XIV. TO THE ROMAN PEOPLE
Herculis ritu modo dicim, O plebs

EOPLE of Rome -it is not many days
Since you were saying “ Caesar buys in Spain
Glory with death.'' Now he comes home again

Like Hercules, a conqueror crowned with bays.

Let his wife joyous in her peerless spouse,
His sister proud of the illustrious chief,

And matrons grateful for their sons' relies,
With supplicants' fillets decorate their brows,

And thanks and homage in the temples pay
To the just Gods 3 and new-wed maids and boys

Follow with reverence‚ hushed all idle moise,
As in their train you tread the Sacred Way.
