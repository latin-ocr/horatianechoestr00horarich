XXIII. TO CHLOE

Vitas hinnuleo me similis, Chloe·

OU shun me, Chloe, like a doe

That through the mountains, sar and wide,
In dread of winds and wood, will go
To seek her timid mother's side.

For whether Spring's first zephyrs shake
The quivering foliage of the trees,

Or the green lizards stir the brake‚
She trembles in her heart and knees.

No lion and no tiger Ι,
Pursuing you to rend your charms 3
No longer to your mother fly,
But nestle in a husband’s arms.
