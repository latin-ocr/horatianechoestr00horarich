188 THE ODES OF ΗΘΚΛ CE

As flame flies thro' pine forest trees
And east winds sweep Sicilian seas.

Thencet'orth in deeds of high emprise
The Roman youth have wrought and grown
In strength3 restored, the temples rise,
In Punic tumults overthrown‚ —
And statues of the Gods again
Adorn the desecrated fane.

Then Hannibal, the faithless, said:
“ Deer, of rapacious wolves the prey,
We follow when we should have fied, --
For do the best that do we may,
The greatest triumph we can know
Is to elude —escape our foe.

“ Brave nation‚ that when Troy was burned,
And in the ashes all seemed lost,
To other lands their faces turned,
And, on the Tuscan billows tost‚
Sons, aged sires, and Lares bore
To cities of the Ausonian shore.
