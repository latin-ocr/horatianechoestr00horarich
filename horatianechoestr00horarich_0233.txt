TO LOLLIUS 201

Thy many labors, Lollius, for the State
Oblivion must not hide; thou hast a mind
Wise in affairs, to no excess inclined,

Firm in bad fortune, nor in good elate ;

Stern foe of fraud and avarice‚ abstaining
With care from that solicitude for pelf
Which seeks to centre all things in itself, —

Not consul one year only, but remaining

At all times consul, While the proffered bribes,
Loyal and true, the magistrate rejects, —
The honest, not the gainful way elects‚

And routs, victorious, sin's opposing tribes.

The man of wealth we do not rightly call
A happy man 3 much happier he who knows
How to enjoy the good that Heaven bestows‚
Accepts its gifts and wisely uses all 3

Endures in patience cruel poverty‚

And deems dishonor worse by far than death3

For friends and country yields his latest breath, —-
Living for them, he dares for them to die.
