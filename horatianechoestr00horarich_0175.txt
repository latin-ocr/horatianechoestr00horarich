TO MERCURJJ‘

Tigers and trees thy voice obey,
And rapid rivers, at thy call

Entranced and calmed, their course delay3
Fierce Cerberus, guardian of the Han, -—

Tho' on his three-tongued head are wreaths
Of hissing snakes, and from his throat
Foul venom issues as he breathes, —-
Was quelled by thy melodious note.

Even Tityos and Ixion smiled

Against their will 3 dry stands the urn
Of Danaus' daughters, while beguiled

By song, from their hard toil they turn.

Let Lyde hear their crime, ——- their fate
A sieve-like water-jar to fill ;

Day after day they work and wait —
In vain—the jar is empty still,

Thus sinners meet their doorn in hell.
Could any deed be more abhorred Ξ

More impious than words can tell, --
They gave their husbands to the sword 1
