VIII. TO LYDIA
Lydia, dic, per omnes

AY, Lydia, how is this —
That by your love you ruin Sybaris?

If any prayer can reach you,

By all the Gods in Heaven Ι beseech you.
You ’ve taught him to detest

The manly sports he always loved the best.
Patient of dust and sun,

Why does he now the open Campus shun ?
Why cease to take a pride

In martial contests‚ -with his peers to ride ?
With jagged bit and rein

why cease his Gallie coursers to restrain ?
Even to take a swirn

In yellow Tiber is too much for him.
Why does he more

Avbid the wrestlers' oil than serpent's gore?
The ponderous quoit he threw

That with the strain his arms were black and blue :
