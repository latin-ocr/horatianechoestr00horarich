VI. TO SEPTIMIUS

Septimi, Gades aditure mecum

’M sure, Septimius, thou wouldst go
To Cadiz with me or explore
The haunts of our unconquered foe
That dwell on the Cantabriam shore, —-
And journey on to Afric lands
Through boiling waves and buming sands.

Worn as⁷ Ι am with war's alarms,
Hard perils, and the billows' rage‚—
Let me in Tibur's rura] charms
Find a calm haven for my age:
Some colonists of Grecian raee
Were the first settlers of the place.

But should the Fates this boon deny,

Tarentum is my second choice 3
