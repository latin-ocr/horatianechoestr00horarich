120 THE ODES OF HORACE

“ Him will Ι welcome to these bright retreats,
To our serene, celestia] fellowship 3
With us shall he nectaream juices sip,
Enrolled among the ranks that fill these Seats.

“While between Ilion and Rome the waves
Shall rage athwart the wide dividing main,
Where it may please them let the exiles reign3
And while on Paris' and on Priam’s graves

“ Herds leap and graze at will, and wild beasts breed
Their cubs unharrned, the Capitol shall stand
Refulgent‚ ——Rome‚ proud queen of every land,

Impose her edicts on the vanquished Mede.

“Her name shall be 3 terror far and wide
To earth's remotest bounds——from Calpe’s Strait
To fields Nile’s swelling waters irrigate,
Through continents estranging 5635 divide:

‘⁶ Stronger when leaving gold within the mine,
There better placed, — despised and so unsought,
Than gathering gold for human uses wrought,
With right hand plundering everything divine.
