 

THE ODES OF HORACE

BOOK Ι

Ι. ΤΟ MAECENAS

Maecetzas atavis edite regibus

LIKE my guardian and my grace,
Maecenas, born of Tusean Kings,
Men live ‘co whom the Olympiam race
With clouds of dust its rapture brings 3
And when the glowing axles graze
But clear the goaL and win the prize‚
The ennobling palm will even raise
Earth's greatest Masters to the skies 3
Him who by Rome's eaprieious choice
Her triple powers and honors wields,
And him whose granaries rejoioe
In all the wealth of Libya’s fields.
The man who lives contented now
To hoe and delve ancestral acres
