JNTRODUCTJON ix

It is not as a critic that I stand for a moment be-
tween Mr. Sargent and his reader, but rather as a
friend who thoroughly recognizes the translator’s fit-
ness for the work he had undertaken. It is deeply to
be regretted that he was called away before he had
completed the whole task Which he had contemplated‚
but we are thankful for the valuable literary legacy he
has left uS.

January, 1893.
