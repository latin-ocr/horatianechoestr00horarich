- XXVIII. ARCHYTAS

Te maris et terroe numeroque carentis arenoe

HEE, measurer of the earth and of the main,
And reckoner of the sands that know no
score‚
Archytas 1 scanty heaps of sand restrain
In hopeless bondage by Matinum’s shore.
Nought it avails thee that thy restless mind
Explored the starry chambers of the sky,
And roamed the earth from pole to pole, —to find,
At last, life's chief commission is to die.
Host of the gods, the sire ot* Pelops falls3
Into thin air Aurora's bridegroom fades 3
Minos, admitted to Jove's secret halls,
His trusted counsessor, mingles with the shades ;
Euphorbus twice 3— on Trojan battlefield
He rendered up the ghost 3 in after days
The sage Pythagoras, as attests the shield
Displayed in Argos to men’s wondering gaze.
