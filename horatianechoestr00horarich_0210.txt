178 THE ODES OF HORA σε

But why, alas, my Ligurine,

Steals the rare tear-drop down my eheeks?
why rise, my broken words between,

The thoughts that only silence speaks?

1 hold you in my midnight dreams ς
Unkind you fiy from my embrace

Over the Campus, through the streams,
Swift as a bird, — and still I chase.
