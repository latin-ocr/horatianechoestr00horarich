XI. TO PHYLLIS
(WITH VARIATIONS)
Est mila· nonum superantis armum

'VE a cask in my garret of Alban wine
And the years it has mellowed are more than
nme ;
With you, my dear Phyllis, this grape—juice Ι 'd share,
There is plenty for both and a little to spare.

In the same garden plot where my roses are blowing‚
Curled parsley and ivy for garlands are growing3
For nothing can heighten the charms of my fair
When she beams with a simple green wreath in her
hair.

The house smiles With silver 3 a tankard ancl tray,
With two polished goblets‚ make quite a display3
With sprigs of verbena the altar is crowned

And covets the lamb for the sacrifice bound.
