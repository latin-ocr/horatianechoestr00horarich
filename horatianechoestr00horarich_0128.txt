96 THE ODES OF ΗΘΚΛ CE

They both sing in strains that are worth being heard,
While listen in silence the crowd of beholders3
But by battles and upsets of tyrants are stirred
More deeply the Shades‚ pressing shoulder on
shoulders.

What wonder! entranced by those marvellous airs,
The attention of Cerberus' sels is enlisted‚
While he droops his black ears and his ravishment
shares
With the snakes in the locks of the Furies entwisted 3

Prometheus the peck of the vulture ignores,
And the sire of Pelops his thirst ; and Orion

To the stars on the pinions of harmony soars,
F orgetting the chase of the lynx and the lion.
