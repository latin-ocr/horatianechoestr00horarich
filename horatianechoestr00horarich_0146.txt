114 THE ODES OF HORACE

Of clients this may have a greater crowd:

It matters not, —all bow to equal laws ;

By lot from her capacious urn Fate draws
Names of the lowliest now, and now the proud.

Sicilian banquets yield him no delight

Who at the table sees above his head

A drawn sword hanging by a single thread ;
Him ——- harps and birds in vain to sleep invite.

The humble homestead of the husbandman
Disdaining not, sleep visits with sweet dreams 5
Nor shuns the shaded banks of running streams‚

Nor Tempe's vale that gentle zephyrs fan.

The man who ourbs his wishes by his needs,
And can enjoy enough, contentedly‚
Looks with no fear on the tumultuous sea,

Nor rise of stormy stars nor setting heeds3

Unruffied‚ though the vines are lashed with hail,
Or winter-killed3 and sterile fields complain
Of torrid stars 3 and trees. of drought or rain‘3

And all the false hopes of the harvest fail.
