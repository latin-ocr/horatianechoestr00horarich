To VAL Glc's 89

Nestor who lived three ages was not weeping
For slain Antilochus through all those years 3

Nor were his parents and his sisters keeping
Their grief for Troilus ever fresh with tears.

Cease then these querulous and doleful measures, —
And paeans to Augustus Caesar sing,

Who from the Orient returns with treasures
And the new trophies that his armies bring.

Rigid Niphates adds to his ovations‚
Its course inlesser waves the Danube rounds,
The Medes are counted with the conquered nations,
And Scythia's horsemen keep within her bounds.
