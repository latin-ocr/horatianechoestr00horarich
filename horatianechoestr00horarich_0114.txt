THE ODES OF HORACE

On sweet Galaesus' banks would I

Amid the pastured flocks rejoice‚
Whose fleeces show the Shepherds' care
In the protecting skins they wear.

No spot on earth, where’er it lies,
For me has such a power to please :
It beams with smiles, its honey vies
With that of the Hymettian bees,
And green Venafrum cannot show
A field where finer olives grow.

The Springs are long, we breathe an air
Moistened with warm and genial rains 3
Flowers and fruits will fiourish there,
And vineyards pay the peasant's pains z
On hills hard by a wine is prest
That ‘s equa] to Falernum’s best.

In that serene and happy seat,
Remote from worldly toil and strife,
Wilt thou with me in calm retreat
Tread the descending path of life, —

Till thou, bereaved, with tears regard
The ashes of thy friend the bard.
