PARAPHRASE OF SE COND EPODE

Or marries to the stately pine
Virginia's green but grapeless vine.

His J'ars the lucid honey fills‚

The maple's luscious juice his pai153
He sees his cattle range the hius,

Or hears them lowing in the vales3
His Southdown lambkins‚ as they play,
Are making mutton every day.

When Autumn lifts his temples crowned

With clustered grapes and tasselled maize,

When buckwheat patches flush the ground,
And woods with gold and scarlet blaze,

Oh, then With what delight he sends

His pears and peaches to his friends!

One basket, Doctor, goes to you,
Who give his casual aches relies ;

One to the preacher’s wife3 and two
Requite the local journal's chief,

Who lustily his trumpet blows

For premiums at the cattle shows,

Sometimes, the 'silver brook beside,
He lies upon the clovered sod3

The willows drip, the waters gude,
Birds sing, and he begins to nod.

His hours in Bachelor's Reveries pass,

Or in the dreams of Sparrowgrass.

Winter comes lowering from the North,
And clouds are white with snow and hail.
