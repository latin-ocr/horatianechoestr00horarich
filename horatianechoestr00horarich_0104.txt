72 THE ODES OF HORACE .

Where is the gulf not crimsoned with our gore ?
What rivers flow with unpolluted tide?

Within earth's limits is there sea or shore
That has not been with Daunian slaughter dyed?

Lest ’[ὴου, my sportive Muse, become too grave,
And for light lays a Cean dirge inspiret,—
With me beneath the Dionaean cave
To livelier measures seek to tune the lyre.
