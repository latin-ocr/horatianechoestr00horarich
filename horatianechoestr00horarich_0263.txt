BOOK III. TWENTY—FOURTH ODE

THIS Ode, under the title of ⁴ Cupidity our Bane‚' is
introduced in ‘ Tracts for the Times ' as follows : —-

⁶ The following Ode was called to mind by my reading
in the papers of the day a number of paragraphs that sug-
gested some of the sels-repetitions of history. It is the
same with us as it was in Horace's day, and our rich men
are only aping the extravagances that were the subjects of
his censure in the times of the Augustan empire. One of
the paragraphs referred to was a commentary on the luxu-
rious living ancl prodigal expenditure that have of late
brought grief to so many households. The love of lucre
and the licentious extravagance of his time are dealt with
by Horace in a masterly way in this ode.’

Mr. Sargent concludes: ‘It was after committing the
above to paper that in calling on a friend 1 Ι found him
with a Horace in his hand. It was a copy of the beautiful
edition of the Didots os Paris, with its exquisite photo-
graphs‚ the text interpreted by the admirable annotation of
John Bond. His remark, as he laid down the volume,
was, “Here is what your people want,’' and my previous
conviction that substantial doses of it would do good even
to our clergymen was strengthened by this concurring
opinion.'
