XXIV. TO VIRGIL

Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus

HAT measure in our mourning can there be
For one so dear -what shame? Sad chants
inspire,
Thou of the liquid voice, Melpomene,
To whom thy father gave it with the lyre.

In his last sleep, then, doth Quintilius lie?

Endowed with virtues more than words can tell, —-
Good Faith and Justice‚ sisters, — Modesty,

And Truth, —when will they find his parallel ?

Quintilius fell, by many good men wept,
By none than Virgil wept more bitterly.
Thy friend entrusted them, the Gods have kept, —
And will not for thy tears restore to thee.
