To PHYLLJS 203

All hands are in motion — no end to the noise!
Here and there run the girls aud get mixed with the
bo s ·
From ἵζε ’fire in the kitchen, the sparks how they
fl 1
Whileythe quivering flames roll the smoke to the
Sky.

The delights of your visit Ι ask for the Ides,

That midway our sweet-budding April divides 3
Venus rose on this day from the foam of the sea,
To make earth Elysium for you, love, and me.

With me this is always a day of festivity,
For the light of it dawned on Maecenas' nativity 3
A day that is sacred, all others above,
To the pleasure and duties of friendship and
love.

While you run after Telephus, clon’t you forget
The young dude is, decidedly, not of your set 3
A girl rich and saucy the darling detains,
And, believe me, he loves to be hugging his chains.
