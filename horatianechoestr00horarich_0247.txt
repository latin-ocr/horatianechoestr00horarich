BOOK Ι. ΤΗΕ FIRST ODE

THIS is received as the dedication of the first pub-
lished collection of Horace's Odes; but whether that
collection embraced two or three books is undetermined.
That this Ode is obviously a prologue, and the last Ode
of the second book well adapted for an epssogue, would
seem to warrant the conclusion of the scholiasts, that the
first two books of Odes were published together before
the third. But it is the opinion of modern students that
the three first books were published together. And the
last Ode of the third book seems, even more than the final
Ode of the second book, to form the close of a collection.
Bentley's hypothesis that each book was published sepa-

rately meets with little favor.

reading adopted in line 29 of this Ode, was left incomplete.
Notes found among his papers have been arranged and ap-

pended to it.]
In translating this first Ode I have adopted the conJec-
ture of ‘te ' instead of ‘me ' in the 29th line ε —-
