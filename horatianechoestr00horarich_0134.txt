102 THE ODES OF HORACE

On little he lives well, indeed,
Whose father's modest salts are bright
On his scant board3 nor care nor greed
Deprives him of his sleep at night.

Why boast of aims unlimited‚
Doomed to so brief a life ? And why
Change for warrn clime ? His country fied,
What exile from himself can fly?

Vile care ascends the brass-beaked ships,
Nor lags the mounted knights behind,
The swiftness of the stag outstrips‚
And cloud-compelling Eastern wind.

The mind rejoieing in to-day
No morrow's troubles need molest:
With gentle smiles drive ills away 3
For nothing is completely blest.

Age wastes Tithonus lingeringly 3
Achilles, glorious, swiftly dies 3
The hour perchance may give to me

A boon that it to you denieS.
