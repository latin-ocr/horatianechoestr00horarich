32 THE ODES OF ΗΘΚΛ CE

“ You in vain for safe keeping on Venus rely,
And bold in her favor all danger defy3
Comb your locks, play the lute, and your measures
divide,
To please the fair women who loll by your side.

“In your chamber you vainly will seek a retreat
From the terrible spears and the arrows of Crete,
The swift—footed Ajax, the din of the strife ;
Though late, you will pay for your lust with your
life.

“There is Nestor of Pylos — dare look in his face,
And there Laertiades, scourge of your raee3
Salaminius Teucer is urging your ssight,
And Sthenelus, knowing and strong in the sight,

“ Nor in guiding the steeds of a chariot slow;
And there is Meriones whom you will know 3
And, raging to meet you —through blood and
through fire —
The son of TydeuS, more brave than his sire.
