'100 THE ODES OF HORACE

Of small account the means of private men 3
T hen public wealth was great. No wide arcade
To private houses lent a grateful shade‚

,And caught the northern summer breezes then.

Despising not the turs that grows at large,—
It was enjoined the buildings of the State
And temples of the Gods to decorate

With quarried marble at the public charge.
