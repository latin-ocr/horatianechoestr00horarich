10 THE ODES OF llle’ACE

Now is the time to make in shacly groves
The offerings Pan loves,

Whether he may demand a lamb 0r bid
Oblation of a kid.

Pale Death before them stalks impartially‚
Whether the portals be

Of peasant or of prince —— hovel or tower —
Alike all feel his power.

O happy Sestius 1 Life's little span
Forbids long hope to man ς

Thy sunny day impending night invades,
T hee wait the sabled Shades,

And Pluto’s narrow house3 where, once thou go,
No more by lucky throw

Of dice wilt thou in banquet hall recline
King of the realms of wine,-

No tender Lycidas will love inspire,
Whose charms thou dost admire, —

Whom rival youths regard with jealous eye,
And maids will by and by.
