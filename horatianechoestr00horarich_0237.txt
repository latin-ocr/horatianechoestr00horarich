XII. TO VIRGIL

Jam veris comites, quoe mare temperant

PRING comes with her companions, the gentle
western gales,
And smooths the waves of ocean and swells the idle
sails 3
The meadows now are frostless, and the streams no
longer flow
With the roar and with the burden of the winter's
melting snow.

The nightingale now builds her, nest, the melancholy
bird,
And now, lamenting Itys, her plaintive notes are heard 3
Perpetual shame to Cecrops' house â€”- the story that
she sings
Because she oruelly avenged the barbarous lust of
kingS.
