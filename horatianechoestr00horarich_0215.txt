ΙΙΙ. ΤΟ MELPOMENE

Quem lu, Melpfflnene, semel

HEN once Melpomene has smiled
Upon the cradle of a child,

He never will aspire to fame

As vietor in an Isthmian game,
Nor look for glory in the lists

With the illustrious pugilists,
Nor to the goal his coursers steer, —-

A bold and skilsul charioteer3
For him no martial exploit weaves

A crown of Delian laurel leaves,
Nor to his arms a triumph brings

For having quelled the rage of king53
But streams that fertile Tibur lave,

And groves that verdant tresses ννεῑνε,
Shall with their scenio charms inspire

A master of the AEolian lyre.
For Rome, the queen of cities‚ deigns

To read and praise my lyric strains‚
