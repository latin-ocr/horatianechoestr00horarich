204 THE ODES OF HORACE

Singed Phaeton’s fate is a sad admonition

To all who indulge a high-flying ambition 3
And Bellerophon's too — he was scaling the skies,
When the Pegasus somerset opened his eyes.

Of these ancient fables the moral is plain, —-

Never strive for a good you can never attain;
Then profit, I pray, by the lesson they teach‚ —
That the grapes are all sour when out of your reach.

Come, queen of my sweethearts ! the last of your sex
My heart with the cyclone of passion to vex 3
Come — come, ——to my lyre you shall carol sweet
airs,
And with music and song we will drive away cares.
