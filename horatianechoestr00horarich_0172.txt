X. TO LYCE

Extremum Tanain si biberes, Lyce

WJERE you born of the Danube’s cold waters to
dnnk‚
As the barbarous wife of a Scythian boor,
In this Norther you ’d not be so cruel, Ι think,
As to leave me stretched out on the sill of your door.

How the gate creaks and slarns as it swings to and
fro 3
You hear the winds whistle and roar ‘through the
trees 3
They shake the fine houses‚ and even the snow
In the crisp air of night is beginning to sreeze.

Pride, hateful to Venus, you ’d better suppress 3
When the rope breaks, the wheel will its circuit re-
trace ;
A Tuscan will never her suitor distress, —

No Penelope ever was born of your race.
