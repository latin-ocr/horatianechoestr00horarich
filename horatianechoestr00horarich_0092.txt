XXXIV. TO HIMSELF

Parcus deorum cultor et infrequens

ISCIPLE of a mad philosophy,
I am a rare, neglectful worshipper
In the Gods' temples ; conscious that Ι err,
Ι must shift sails, my course retraced shall be:

For Jupiter, -— whose wont it is to sunder
With his forked fire the sky that tempests shroud, —
Through the pure air serene, without a cloud,

Has driven his chariot swift, and Steeds of munder, —-

By which the inert earth and running rivers, —
By which the Styx and Taenarus’ horrid seat, —
The gate of hell, — with strange pulsations beat,

And the far Atlantean summit shivers.
