VIII. TO BARINE
Ulla si juris tibi perjeratz'

ARINE, if 3 lapse in truth
Had ever worked thee any harm,
Darkened 3 nail, or stained 3 tooth‚
Or robbed thee of 3 single charm—

Ι might believe! But, perjured, thou
Dost with 3 brighter lustre slfine,
Youth's cynosure, —eaeh broken vow
Adds graces to that form of thine.

Swear by the deathless deities,
The ashes of thy mother’s urn,
Night’s silent signs that stud the skies, -—

All thy false oaths to profit turn.
