VI. TO AGRIPPA

Scriberis V ario fortis et hostium

HE glorious history shall Varius write,
Borne on Maeonian wing, in epic stratio,
Of what bravo soldiers did by land and main,
With you their leader in victorious fight.

We cannot treat‚ Agrippa, themes like these,
Nor Pelops' tragic house, nor the grave wrath
Of stern Pelides, nor the devious path

Of double-faeed Ulysses through the seas ε

Such are not in our vein. Humility
And the bravo mistress of the sportive lyre
Bid us not bate through lael< of native fire
Praisos of matchless Caesar and of thee.
