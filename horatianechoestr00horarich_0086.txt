XXXI. TO APOLLO
Quid dedebatum poscit Apollinem

O Apollo, what prayer, on his shrine’s dedication,
Shall the bard offer up as he pours his libation?
Not for harvests that fertile Sardinia yields‚
Nor the sleek herds of sunny Calabrian fields,
Not for ivory brought from the Indian lands,
Nor for gold that is filtered through African sands,
Not for farms which the beautiful Liris laveS‚ —
Silent river 1 that runs with the softest waves 3—
F or grapevines of Cales he ⁷11 not importune,
Which they on whom fortune bestows them may prune z
Let the merchant delight in his goblets of gold,
And drain at a draught all the liquor they hold 3
For well of his wealth and his wine he may boast, —-
The gains of his trade on the Syrian coast 3
He 's a pet of the Gods, —three or four times a year
The Atlantic he tempts with no perils to fear.
Mallows, olives, and endives suffice for my diet 3 ι
