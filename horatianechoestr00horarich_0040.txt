8 T ,ΗΕ OJJES Off JJOA'A GE

Daedalus, wafted through the vacant air

On wings not given to man, pursued his course,
Nor vainly did Hercu1ean labor dare

Its way through Acherontian bounds to force.

Nought seems too high for mortals to attain 3

We scale heaven’s summits in our foolish pride3
So sinful are we, Jove desires in vain

To lay his wrathful thunderbolts aside.
