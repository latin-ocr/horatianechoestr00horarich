14 THE ODES OF HORACE

Who shall write worthily of Mars arrayed

In mail of steel ? Or of Meriones

Black with Troy’s dust? or, peer of desties,
Tydides, victor by Minerva⁷s aid ?

Banquets we sing of and the fierce affrays
Of youths beset by maidens with clipped nails, —.
Whether we conquer love, or love prevasss,

In heart and spirit buoyant all our days.
