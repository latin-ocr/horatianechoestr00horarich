To CALLJOPE 1 25

But what could threats and violence avass,
When Rhaetus, Mimas, all the savage crew‚
Enceladus, who trees uprooted threw,

Frightful Porphyrion and Typhoie'us quail —

Rushing against Minerva's sounding shield3
Here Vulcan stood, impatient for the fray,
The matron Juno here, while Patara

And Delos sent Apollo to the field :

Whose bow is on his shoulders ever laid,

Who bathes his flowing looks in crystal dew

Of Castaly, who Lycia's thickets haunts‚ — and who
F inds home and altar in his native glade.

Force lacking wisdom falls by its own weight 3
Force tempered by refinement Gods approve,
And list to lofty heights 3 forces that move

Men's minds to deeds of wickedness they hate.

How true this precept is let Gyas tell,
The hundred—handed3 and Orion too,
Who dared the maiden huntress to pursue,
And pierced by Dian’s virgin arrow fell.
