TO MAECENAS 173

And echo, from the mountains round
And neighboring woods‚ repeats the sound.

A happy life that morta] leads
Who, master of himself, can say,
As rolling year to year succeeds,
Come what come will I 've lived to-day z
To-morrow God may fill the sky
With cloud or sunshine — what care I ?

The past He cannot render vain,

Nor aught that once is done undo 3
Nor things imperfect reordain,

Nor things concluded shape anew3
Nor for a fieeting moment stay
What once the hour has swept away,

Fortune her cruel business plies,
And insolently plays her play 3
Nor caring who may fall or rise, —-
Delights to flatter and betray5
Benignant though at times she be,

To others now, and now to me.
