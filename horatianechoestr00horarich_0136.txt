XVII. TO MAECENAS

C ur me querelis exanimas tuis L?

’ HY wilt thou Worry me with thy complaining?
Why sear, Maecenas, ills that may betide—
That thou shouldst go before, and Ι remaining
Lament for thee, my pillar and my pride.

If our united lot the Fates should sever,
And snatch my spirit’s better part away, —
Thou lost! of life’s delights bereft forever,
Why should my other half its ssight delay?

One hour the common doom shall find us sharing3
Believe me that I take no faithless oath, —
In our complete companionship preparing

For the last journey that awaits us both.
