V. TO PYRRHA

Quis multa gracilis te puer in rosei

HAT slender youth with roses crowned,
With liquid odors persumed well,
My charming Pyrrha, hast thou found
To woo thee in his pleasant cell, —
For whom dost braid thy yellow hair
And don thy simple robe with care ?

Alas 3 how often shall he weep

For broken vows and gods estranged‚
Who, dreaming by the glassy deep,

Beholds amazed its aspect changed, —-
Black winds and surging waves arise

For gentle airs and summer skies‚ —-

Who now enjoys thy golden prime

And hopes thou ’lt always be his own,
