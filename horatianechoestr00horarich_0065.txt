THE PROPHECY OF NEREUS 33

“ And yon, —— as the deer for no pastures will stay
When he catches a glimpse of the wolf far away, —
At the sight of him run, till you gasp, out os
breath‚ —-
Though you ’ve promised your mistress you ⁷11
fight to the death.

‘⁴ For a while will the wrath of Achilles delay
The coming of Ilion's funeral day3
But with fire Achaean I see it in flames,
And I hear the loud wail of the Phrygian dames.''
