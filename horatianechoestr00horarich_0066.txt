XVI. A PALINODE
O matre pulchra filia pulchrior

F a beautiful mother more beautiful daughter,
Forgive mesor having made light of her name 3
My sharp verses consign to the fire or the water 3
So they perish — I care not by flood or by flame.

It was anger that urged me to censure so freely‚

And it goads to such madness as nothing else can 3
Not the Pythian or Bacchus or sceptred Cybele

With their wild rites so shatter the reason of man.

Not flames of the fire, not storms of the ocean,
Nor Noric swords e'er turn aside from his path, —
Nor the thunders of Jove, with their deafening com-
motion, -—
The mortal who burns with the frenzy of wrath.
