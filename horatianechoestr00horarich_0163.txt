VI. TO THE ROMANS

Delicta majorum immeritus lues

INS of the fathers thou must expiate -—
Tin, Roman, thou restore the crumbling sanes
And images begrimed with smoke and stains,
And all the sacred places of the State.

The Gods all things originate and end ;
To reverence of them thou owest thy sway 3
Thou rulest through the Gods thou dost obey 5
The Gods neglected countless evils send.

The bands of Pacorus and Monaeses twice
Have bravely our ill-omened onsets crushed‚
And added, with their gainful victories fiushed,
Rich booty to their collars of small price.
