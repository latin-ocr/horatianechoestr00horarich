XVII. TO TYNDARIS

Velox amoenum soepe Lucretilem

IS Arcadian hills nimble Faunus exchanges
For a trip now and then to my Sabine retreat,
And good· naturedly shelters my fiocks where he
ranges,
From the winds that bring rain, and the fiery heat.

Here safe in his charge roam my she-goat com-

Seeking thyme and wild strawberries hid in the
brakes 3
They stray as they please through my grove with im-
punity‚
And harbor no sear of the wolves and the snakes

In the thickets of savage Haedilia abounding:
While the sweetest of airs from his shepherd pipe

floats,
