XXIX. TO ICCIUS

leci, beatis nunc Arabum invides

O, Iccius, you now look with covetous eye
On the treasures of Araby 3 leaving your letters
To compel her invincible monarchs to fly,
And to send home the terrible Parthian in fetters.

Of the barbarous virgins whose lovers you 'll slay,
To find one as a handmaiden will you be able ?
Or a boy skilled in archery hope to display,
With looks perfumed and trimâ€š serving wine at your
table ?

After this no one need to feel any surprise

In beholding the rivers ascend to the mountains,
Or one moment refuse to believe his ovvn eyes

If they see yellow Tiber run back to his fountains 3
