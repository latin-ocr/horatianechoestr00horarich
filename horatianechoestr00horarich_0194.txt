162 THE ODES OF HORACE

What boots it to complain
If cunning crime escapes its due requital ?
And human laws, how vain!
Without the morals that must make them vital, —-

If men for gainful trade
Pursue its quest where tropic fervors glow‚
Or Borean reahns invade,
And regions stiff with ice and white with snow, —

Or stormy seas cut through,
To shun the great disgrace of poverty, —-
And all things bear and do —
Deserting Virtue's path that leads on high.

If we our sins deplore‚ —
Or let us hurry to the Capitol
With all our precious store
(While clamoring crowds the sacrifice extol)

Gems, stones‚ and useless gold 3

Or let us throw them in the nearest sea, -—
For justIy do we hold

Our rankest evil base cupidity.
