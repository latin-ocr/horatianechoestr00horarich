4 THE ODES OF HORACE

We have seen yellow Tiber hurling back
Impetuous billows from the Tuscan shore,

To sweep away in his relentless track ’
Temple and tower that Numa built of yore.

On his left bank the surges overflow—

The uxorious river would avenge the wrongs
Of Ilia wailing with excess of woe

For deeds whose chastisement to Jove belongs.

The Roman youth, thinned by their fathers' guilt,
Shall hear that oivie strife made sharp the blade
By which the Persian blood were better spilt
Than blood of friends in hostile ranks arrayed.

When ruin threats the empire —in despair,
What Deity shall the people supplicate ?

How shall the sacred virgins press their prayer
On Vesta, angry at the pontiff's fate?

Romans beneath their crime inexpiate quai13
Who, mighty Jove, shall their deliverer be?

Thine image radiant through its misty veil,
Augur Apollo, shall we turn to thee?
