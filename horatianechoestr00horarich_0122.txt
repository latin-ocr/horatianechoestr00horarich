XI. To QUINTIUs

Quid bellicosus Cantaber et Scythes

- ΗΥ inquire what next the Cantabrian intends,
Or whether the Scythians continue our
friends ?
Little need, my dear Quintius, of bulwarks to screen
us,
While the broad Adriatic is rolling between us.

All the wants of your age frugal means will supply 3
Youth and beauty are always too ready to fly 3
Easy sleep and sweet loves, added years drive
away, —
Though your nap after dinner is coming to stay.

The same splendor not always invests the spring
flowers 3
The moon does not shine with one face at all hours:
