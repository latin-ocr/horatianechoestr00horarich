192 THE ODES OF HORACE

He would not by an impious stratagem‚

When Trojans took an ill-starred holiday

And Priam’s halls with song and clance were gay,
Enter the walls of Troy to capture them:

But for the captives ;— oh ἕ the cruel shame 1—
Without one pang of pity he would wreak
Vengeanee on boys unable yet to speak,

And burn the babe unborn in Grecian flame, —

H ad not, by genia] Venus' prayer and thine,
Jove vowed AEneas' fortune to restore,
That he might build upon another shore
Walls on which more auspicious stars should shine.

To guard the honor of the Daunian Muse,

O great Apollo, ever young and fair!

Phoebus who bath'st in Xanthus' stream thy hair,
Thalia's teacher‚ do not thou refuse l

Phoebus in me the art of song inspireS,
Phoebus bestows on me the poet’s name l -
Maidens who from the purest lineage came, '
And boys the offspring of Patrician sires,
