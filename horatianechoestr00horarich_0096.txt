64 THE ODES OF ΗΘΚΛ CE

Α135, of brothers’ blood we bear the stains 1
Shame be upon us for our scars and crimes!
Ah, cruel race 1 in these, our hardened times,

What form of wickedness untried remains ἔ

F ear of the Gods checks not Youth’s impious hands.
What altars spate they? — F orge our blunted
swords
On a new anvil. Turn them on the hordes
Of Massagetan and Arabian lands Ξ
