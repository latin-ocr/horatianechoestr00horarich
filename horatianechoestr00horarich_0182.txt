150 THE ODES OF HORACE

Philip, the subtle man of Macedon,
Opened by bribes strong cities' hostile gates,
And undermined the kings of rival States 3
By bribes rough captains of the sea are won.

Increasing heaps of gold Care sits beside,
Hungering for greater. I, with reason, dread
Above the crowd to list my modest head,

Like thee, Maeeenas 1 of our knights the pride.

The more we mortals to ourselves deny,
The more the Gods bestow. The little band
Who covet naught, I join with empty hand,
And from the rich a glad deserter fly.

N obler by far my mean estate Ι hold,
Than had I hoarded from her fertile fields
In my own granaries all Apulia yields,
And lived a pauper with uncounted gold.

The brook that skirts my meadow, and my few
Acres of wood, the crops my farm affords,
Give me more sweet contentment than the lor²ds
Of Libya’s richest province ever knew.
