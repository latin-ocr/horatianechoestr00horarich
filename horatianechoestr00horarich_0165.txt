TO THE ROMAA'S I 3 3

Not from such parents sprung, mother or sire,
The youth that great Antiochus withstood‚
Smote Pyrrhus, stained the sea with Punic blood,
And sealed the fate of Hannibal the dire.

But a brave race and virtuous filled the land,
Husbandnoen-soldierS, taught to till the soil
With Sabine plough, and used to manly toil 3

Obedient to a mother’s stern command

They bring their fagots home, their work not done,
When mountain shadows lengthen toward the East,
And wearied oxen from the yoke released

Browse in the quiet of the setting sun.

Its course the world from base to haser runs,
Our fathers'worse than their ancestral times 3
Our own polluted by still greater crimes —

To be eclipsed in baseness by our sons'.
