THE ODES OF HORACE

Outbursts of vagrant license eease,

And all is order and repose 3
Thy hand that stays the people's crimes
Restores the arts of olden timesÍ¾

Arts which have spread the Latin name,
Increased the might of Italy,

Founded the empire's matchless fame
And all embracing majesty,

Till they have spanned the earth's extent

From sunset to the Orient.

While we have Caesar at our head,
Serene custodian of the state,
No civil fury shall we dread,
Nor feuds that cities desolate 3
The rage that fires barbarian hordes
Shall never sharpen Roman swords.

Not they who dwell upon its banks
And the deep Danube's waters drink,

No faithless Parthian's quivered ranks,
No natives of the Tanai's' brink,

No tribes about the Larian lake,

The Julian ediets dare to break.
