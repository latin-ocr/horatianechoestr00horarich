ΙΙΙ. THE HONEST MANV

Justum et tenacem propositi viram

HE just man whom fixed purposes control,
No base commands of the mad populace,
No terrors frowning in a tyrant's face,
Affright, or shake his ever-constant soul —

Nor raging Winds that rule the Hadrian Sea,
Nor bolts by Jove's red hand in lightning hurled—
Amid the crash of a collapsing world

Unterrified‚ in his integrity.

Thus Pollux and wide-wandering Hercules
With patient §triving reached the starry skie53
Augustus with them at the banquet lies,

His lips with nectar purpled — at his ease.
