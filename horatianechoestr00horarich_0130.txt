THE ODES OF HORACE

In vain from bloody Mars we ’re free,
Or hoarse surge of the Hadrian sea 3
In vain from noxious vapors fly
That South winds breed in Autumn's sky3

To the sad shades we all must ἕο,

See black Cocytus winding slow‚
See Sisyphus his long toil ply,
And Danaus' hateful family.

Lands you must leave, and home, and wife. 3
And of the trees you nurse in life

None, save the cypresses we hate,

Shall mourn their short-lived master’s fate.

A worthier heir shall drain the lees
Of casks you guard with countless keys,
And stain the floor with choicer wine
Than crowns the board where pontiffs dine.
