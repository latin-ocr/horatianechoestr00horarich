126 THE ODES OF HORA CE

Earth mourns the monsters prisoned in her cavea
And grieves for offspring to wan Orcus sent
By lightning 3 nor is flaming AEtna rent

By the swift fire that underneath thern raves.

The heart of Tityos still the vulture tears,
His lust clmstising, warden of his pains 3
And the dire burden of three hundred chains
The libertine Pirithbus ever bears.
