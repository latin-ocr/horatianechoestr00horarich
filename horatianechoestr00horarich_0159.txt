V. REGULUS

Coelo tonantem credidimus Jovem

x* E hear Jove thundering and believe he reigns
In heaven 3 on earth a present deity
Shall our imperial Augustus be --
Britain and Parthia widening his domains.

Have Crassus' soldiers truckled to their fate?
Can Marsians and Apulians lead base lives,
Slaves to the sires of their Barbarian wives —

(Mas, the inverted morals of the State 1)

And under Parthian tyrants make a home,
Their name, their robe, the sacred shields forget
And Vesta’s shrine, whose fires are burning yet,
Jove's temple still the Capitol of Rome ?
