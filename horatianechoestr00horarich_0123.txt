TO QCJA'TJUS 91

Why do you in your mind without respite revolve
The riddles eternity only can solve ?

Why not, under the plane-treet or under this pino,
With no thought in the world but of pleasure‚ recline, -—-
With roses crown locks that are verging to gray,

And, well perfmned, indulge in good wine while we
may?

Gay Bacchus is potent to drive away troubles, —

Our sorrows he halves, and our transports he doubles 3
What boy at my beck will come hither the quieker
To cool in the stream this Falernian liquor ?

What boy bring the singing-girl forth from her home,
Shy Lyde who little is given to roam ?
Bid her come with her lyre, ancl let her take care
In the true Spartan fashion to knot up her hair.
