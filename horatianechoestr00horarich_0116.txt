THE ODES OF HORACE

Ignobly left behind my shield,

When Valor {altered in the fight -
And in the sordid dust the brave,
Who looked for victory, found a grave.

Fate sheltered me — my guardian then
Was the swift-footed Mercury 3

Veiled in dense clouds, through hostile men,
He bore me safe 3 but as for thee,

Thy wreck upon a stormy main

Engulfed thee in the wars again.

Let then thy vows to Jove be paid,
And thOU, at peace with all thy foes,
Beneath my laurel's tranquil shade
Awhile thy war—worn limbs repose 3
And never scruple to make free
With casks long since reserved for thee.

Pour persumes from capacious shells‚
Fill up the polished bowls with wine 3
Oblivion of 311 sorrow dwells
In clusters of the Massic vine :
Parsley and myrtle twigs, who now
Shall weave in garlands for thy brow?
