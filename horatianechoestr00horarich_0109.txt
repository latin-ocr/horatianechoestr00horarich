IV. TO XANTHIAS

Ne sit ancillae tibi amor pudori

AY, Xanthias‚ deern it not a shame
The love you to a handrnaid gave,
For great Achilles did the same, —-
The blonde Briseis was a slave.

Ajax, the son of Telamon,

Captive Tecmessa's charms inspired 3
A virgin, spoil in battle W0n‚

The heart of Agamemnon fired

When the Thessalian felled in fight
Fieree hordes, and Hector snatched away
Made for the wearied Greeks more light
The task of taking Pergama.
