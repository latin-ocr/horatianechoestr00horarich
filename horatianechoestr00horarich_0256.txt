224 APPENDIX

To conquer in thy praise and shine
The glory and the grace be mine! 1

Dr. P. Francis, father of the celebrated Sir Philip
Francis, writes in 1753: ‘We are obliged for this correc-
tion of Rutgersius. It seems necessary, even in the Con-
duct of the Ode, that Horace, after having marked the
prevailing Inclinations of mankind in general, should par-
ticularly mention the peculiar Passion of Maecenas, before
he speaks of his own. In the common reading, “ me,'' the
Poet sayS, the crown of ivy raises him to converse with
Gods, Dis miscent superis, yet in the last Lines, he wishes
for the Judgment and Approbation of Maecenas to raise
him to Heaven. The Correction is not less probable, than
it is necessary, since the first letter of the line does not
appear in some Manuscripts. The Copyists probably
wrote many Lines without the first Letters, intending af-
terwards to blazon them, and sometimeS, as perhaps in this
Instance, they forgot them entirely.'

Francis renders, —

An Ivy wreath fair Learning's Prize,
Raises Maecenas to the Skies.2

J. Valart, 1770, says, ‘ Sic primus edidit doctissimus
Hare. Nemo enim quod jam habet, is aliorum poscit.'

A marginal note in a copy of Horace says, ⁶ Facilis est
lapsus in veteribus libris exscribendis a T in M!

Dr. Samuel Shaw in 1724, in his ‘ Syntax for Children,'
adopted the reading. In 1724 WVilliams, in the second edi-

1 Olympia, I. 115.
2 Of Francis‘s translations Dr. Johnson said, ‘The lyrical
part of Horace can never be perfectly translated. Francisuhas

done it the best. 1’11 take his five out of six against them
all.’
