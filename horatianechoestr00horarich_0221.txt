DRUSUS

“ A race that, —like the black-leaved oak,

The growth of fertile Algidus,
Shorn by the two-edged axe's stroke, —
With a. new strength repairs its loss ;
In slaughter and defeat they feel
New eourage bounding from the steel.

“A prodigy ἒ and none so great
Since Hercules the Hydra slew
When, as he lopped the monster's head,

Straight from the wound another grew 3

Or Jason's feat, or Cadmus’ when
From dragon's teeth sprang armed men.

“ Plunge it in depths profound‚ —it will
Again with greater beauty rise 3
Fight it, — and gloriously still
The unscathed victor it defies,
And hostile legions puts to rout —
In battles wives will talk about.

“ Couriers to Carthage, proud to spread
News of my triumphs, Ι again

Shall never send, — for Fortune fied
Our camp when Hasdrubal was slain ς
