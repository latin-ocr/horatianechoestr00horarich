TO VIRGIL 207

I don't intend to stain my cups unless you pay your
share, —-

My house is not the palaee of a double millionnaire.

Forget awhile pursuit of gain, and lay aside delay,
And, mindful of the funeral fires, be happy while you
ma :
'Tis stet at proper time and place to get a little
'011 ‚—
The Jverz wisest thing in life is wisdom mixed with
folly.
