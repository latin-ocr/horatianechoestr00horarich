80 THE ODES OF ΗΘΚΛ CE

She may fly from you now but she soon will pursue 3
Cruel Time gives her years that he pilfers from you;
And soon will your Lalage join in the chase
For a husoand, with never a blush on her face.

More beloved than Chloris of shoulder so white
That she shines like the moon on the water by night,
Or than Pholoe ever coquettish and coy,
Or than beautiful Gyges the Cnidian boy—

Whom if you should mix in a bevy of girls,

With his delicate face and his loose flowing curls‚
It would bother a Stranger, when trying his best,
To tell which was which, and pick him from the rest.
