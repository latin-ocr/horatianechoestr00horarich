HORACE

A stripling walks the streets of Rome,
With slate and satchel on his arm 3
His life abroad, his ways at home,
A loving father⁷s care and charm.

Fulfilment of his boyhood's dream,

Greece weleomes now the freedman’s son 3
He haunts the groves of Academe,

And quaffs the springs of Helicon.

Light of the World Ξ the centra] seat
Of wit and wisdom, art and lore, —
In Athens patriot exiles meet
Where bards and Sages met before.

No athlete, and no warrior he,
With Brutus on Philippi's field,
The darling of Melpomene,
Not bravely, throws away his shield.

Her fleets dispersed and tempest-tost,

Her armies crushed, their leaders slain, —
Now is the great Republic lost,

Lost never to revive again.
