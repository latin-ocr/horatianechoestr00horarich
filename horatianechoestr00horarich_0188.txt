XIX. TO TELEPHUS

Quantum distet ab Inaclzo

ROM Inachus how many years have rolled by,
To Codrus who dared for his country to die,
Of AEacus' race, and the heroes who fell
In the battles they fought about Ilium, —— you tell :

But as to the price of a prime Chian wine,

Or who will afford us a house where to dine,
Who will temper our bath, and at what time of day,
And how to keep warm, —- you have nothing to say.

To the new Moon, and quickly to Midnight a cup,
And a butnper to Augur Murena fill up ;
Mix, each to his liking, the water and wine,

And pour in the goblets three measures or nine. v
