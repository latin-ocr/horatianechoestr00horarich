ΧΙΙ. AUGUSTUS

Quem virum aut heroa lyra vel acri

HAT man or hero wilt thou choose‚
On the sharp pipe to sound his fame,
Or on the lyre—what god, my Muse ?
So Echo shall repeat his name

In notes that Orpheus sang of old,
When trees to listen hurried on
From Pindus, or from Haemus cold,

Or shady lands of Helicon :

Gifted with all his mother's skill,
The river's rapid ssight he stayed3

To hear his strains swift winds were still,
The oaks his tuneful strings obeyed.
