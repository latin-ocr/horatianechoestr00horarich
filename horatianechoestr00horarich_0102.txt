Ι. ΤΟ POLLIO

Motum ex Metello consule civicum

HE civil movement in Metellus' dayS‚
The causes of our war, its foremost men
In fatal friendships bound, their vieious ways,
The tricks that fickle F ortune played us then,

Arms smeared with blood unexpiated still —
When themes like these the historic pen inspire,
You tread a pathway countless perils fill,
Where treacherous ashes crust the latent fire.

The austere Muse of tragedy may wait :

So leave the stage awhile, and by and by,
When you have finished with affairs of State,
For the Cecropiam buskin’s honors try.
