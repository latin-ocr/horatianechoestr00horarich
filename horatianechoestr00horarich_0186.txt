XVIII. TO FAUNUS

Fauna, ,Nympharum fugientum amator

AUNUS 1 of whom the nymphs are shy,
And from thy rude earesses fly,

Tread lightly thou my sunny fields‚

And spate the nurslings nature yields.

As every year its round fills up

Ι slay a kid, and fill the cup
To Venus and her friend with wine,
While incense smokes thy ancient shrine.

When comes thine own December day
The flocks in grassy meadows play3
And oxen from the yoke released
Share with the villagers thy feast.
