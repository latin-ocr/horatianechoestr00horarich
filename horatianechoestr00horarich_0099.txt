XXXVII. CLEOPATRA
Nunc est bibendum, mmc pede libero

N OW is the time to drink your wine,
To merrily dance in the open air,

Now for the Salian priests to dine
At banquets fit for the gods to share.

The Caecuban that your fathers stored, —
To have broken its seals a shame had been,
While your city was doomed by a savage horde,
And the Empire pledged to a frenzied Queen.

With her countless host of miscalled men,
Crippled by lust and foul with disease‚
She was drunk with prosperous fortune, when

Her galleys swept the6Hesperian seas.
