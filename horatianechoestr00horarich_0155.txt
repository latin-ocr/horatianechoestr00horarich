To CALLJOPE 1 2 3

It was a marvel all the country round 3
In Bantine meadows, in the little nest
Among the rocks on Acherontia's erest,
And in Forentum's fertile lower ground:

That I should slumber sweetly in the wild,
’Mid bears and vipers, and escape unharmed‚
My life by laurels and by myrtles eharmed —
The fearless boy a God-protected child.

Yoms, Muses, yours 1 now and forevermore ;
Whether Ι dwell on eool Praeneste's peak,
Or Sabine hius, or Tibur's valley seek,

Or the bright atmosphere of Baiae‘s shore.

Friend to your founts and choirs‚ and you to me!
For me was stemmed Philippi's adverse tide,
The aecursed tree’s fell blow was turned aside,

And my bark saved on the Sieilian sea.

While you are with me, as a mariner
I will defy the stormy Bosphorus' math,
Nor shall the many perils of the path

My steps from Syria's burning sands deter :
