IX. AN AMOEBEAN ODE

Donec gratus eram tibi

HORACE

N old times when thou gav’st me thy heart with
Ι thy charms‚
And none other encircled thy waist with his arms,
When the whitest of necks on my bosom reclined‚
There never was kingdom so much to my mind.

LYDIA

When thy beart was on fire with no other she,

And Chloe the charmer was nowhere to me,
Then Lydia was happy, and Lydia’s fame
In its lustre eclipsed Roman Ilia's name.

HORACE

Α It is true, Thracian Chloe I fondly admire,
She is versed in sweet measures and skilled on the lyre,
My life any moment I gladly would give,

Might the {ates only suffer her spirit to live.
