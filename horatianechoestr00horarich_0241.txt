To AUGUSTUS 209

While presently the elder Nero wages
War with the savage Rhaetian mountaineers,
And with imperial auspices appears
Conspicuous where the hottest battle rages 3

Showing in mortal combats how to quell
Men that would die rather than not be free 3
Victims to their wild love of liberty,

With wounds in front and face to heaven they fell.

And as the south wind tames the unbridled waves,
And clouds are severed in the Pleiads' dances,
Through paths of fire his uncurbed courser prances,

Where harried legions find their countless graves 3

Or like the Aufidus that roaring flows,
Bull-headed, through Apulian Daunus' malms,
And in resistless fury overwhelms

The crop which on its well-tilled border grows :

Thus Claudius in impetuous onset rushedâ€š

The embattled legions clest, nor lost a man3

He strew'ed the field with corpses, rear and van,
And hordes of iron-clad barbarians crushed.
