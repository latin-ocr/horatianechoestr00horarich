XXXIII. TO ALBIUS TIBULLUS

Albi, ne doleas plus nimio memor

Y Albius, don't pose as a martyr to grief,
T ho' Glycera turn on your suit a cold shoul-
der 3
Nor in piteous elegies seek for relies,
When you find she prefers a young beau to an older.

While all Rome her pretty low forehead admires‚
Lycoris with passion for Cyrus is burning 3
Cyrus fancies in Pholoe all he desires,
While she the old sinner is cruelly spurning.

Thus the kids from the wolves in Apulia run 3
And this pleases Venus, who seeks to entangle
Her dupes in such meshes‚ enjoying the fun

When an ill-mated pair in a brazen yoke wrangse.
