XXI. TO DIANA AND APOLLO

Dianam tenerae dicite virgines

ING, tendor maidens, in Diana's praise3
Ye boys, to unshorn Cynthius tune your lays ;
Sing of Latona too, above
All others dear to Jove.

Sing ye of her who in the leafy heights

And the cold stream of Algidus delights‚
Or Erymanthus’ sylvam shades
Or Cragus’ grassy glades. ι

Hail, boys, Apollo, with applausivo alrs,
Who with the quiver on his shoulder bears
His brother’s Iyre ε with Tempe's vale,
His natal Delos hail ἔ
