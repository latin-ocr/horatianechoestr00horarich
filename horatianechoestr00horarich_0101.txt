XXXVIII. TO HIS SERVANT

Persicos odi, puer, apparatus

Ι ΗΑΤΕ, boy, the pomp and parade of the Per-
slan, —
These finden-bound wreaths are my special aversior] 3
Cut-fiovvers in their season will do for my posies, -
So omit any search for the last of the roses.

On your zeal for these gauds Ι make no requisiti0n‚
A few sprigs of myrtle will need no addition 3
Myrtle suits me in vine-mantled arbor rechming,
And suits yon, the servant who waits on my dining.
