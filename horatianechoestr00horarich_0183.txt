TO MAE CENAS 1 5 1

Happier my lot! though no Calabrian bees
Their honey hive for me3 no fleeces fine
Grow thick in Gallie pastures 3 ancl no wine

Mellows in well-sealed jars on Formian lees.

My home knows naught of sordid poverty‚
And had Ι need of more, more you would give 3

By narrowing my desires‚ I better live
On my revenues, scanty though they be,

Than if o’er one continuous stretch of land
Lydian and Phrygiam kingdoms owned my sway.
They who orave much, much laek3 the blest are

the
To whom {Trod gives enough with sparing hand.
