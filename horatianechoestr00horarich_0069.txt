To TYNDARJS 3 7

Through the valleys of sloping Ustica resounding, —
And the polished rocks, Tyndaris, echo the notes.

The Gods are my guardians, the Gods like my piety‚
And are pleased with my Muse ,- from their bounty
shall flow
For your use all the fruits of the earth to satiety‚
All the pleasures that Nature alone can bestow.

In this valley sequestered the too ardent kisses
Of Sirius at noontide you always may shun‚
While you sing Teian songs of the wife of Ulysses‚
And of slippery Circe, — two striving for one!

And here you shall quaff, 'neath the vine-leaves that
screen us,
The mild wines from Lesbian clusters exprest3
And never shall Mars and the ward of Silenus
With their petulant outbreaks our quiet molest.

You 'll be free from all danger of Cyrus' appearing,
With jealous suspicion your secrets to probe, —

To snatch at the wreaths to your tresses adhering
Or tear into tatters your innocent robe.
