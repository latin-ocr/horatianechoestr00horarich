busy working up what was known as the Galphin
claim, in which he was personally interested. Mr. .
Sargent not only declined to say a word in his defence,

but made such comments on the transaction as ren· .

dered the editors' relations with the cabinet rather
equivocal‚ and subsequently he and another of the
editors withdrew from the paper. But on President
F illmore's entrance into office Mr. Sargent was asked
to resume his connection with “The Republic,'' and
continued to conduct it till the close of the adminis-
tration.

The account he gives of the political situation at
this period is not without interest. “ During the Whig
Convention of 1852 I saw Mr. Webster daily, break-
fasted with him, and dined with him 3 and spent the
entire forenoon with him on the day when it was an·
nounced on a Wall Street bulletin that he would cer-
tainly be nominated on the next ballot. Mr. Fillmore
I also saw often 3 and if Ι can judge from what both
said, there was no time during the session of that
convention when either of those gentlemen would
not gladly have transferred his votes to the other to

secure his nominati0n‚ if such a transfer had been
possible.''
