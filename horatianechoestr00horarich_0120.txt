IX. TO VALGIUS

,Non semper imbres nubibus kzkpidos

OT always from the clouds are showers descend-
ing,
From hail and sleet the fields are sometimes free3
Not always are the angry winds contending
To swell the surges of the Caspian sea 3

Not at all seasons, Valgius, are the fountains
Of bleak Armenia clogged with ice and snow,
Nor oaks and ash- trees on the Apuliam mountains
Wldoxx ed of foliage u hen the north winds blow.

In sighs and tears thou wastest days — and morrows —
For Mystes lost, — no respite to thy grief!
The evening star looks down upon thy sorrows,

And morning's sunshine brings the} no relies. .
