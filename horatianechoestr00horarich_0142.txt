110 THE ODES OF HORACE

And I may sing too of the happy sponse,
By thee an added honor to the skies,

The heavy fall of Pentheus' ruined house,
And the fell stroke by which Lycurgus dies.

Thou swayest the rivers, thou the barbarous sea,
And in the distant mountains, moist with wine,
With wreathed vipers thou dost harmlessly
The tresses of thy Bacchanals entwine.

When the fell Giants scaled the upward track
Thy father's realm in impious rage to storm‚
Thy claws and dreadful fangs hurled Rhoetus back —

Thy godhead hidden in a lion's form.

Though called more fit for game and roundelay
And jests — and even held of small account

In war— thou wast as potent in the fray, —
Alike in peace and battle paramount.

Even Cerberus to thee could wish no harm
Bright with thy golden horn, adornment meet, ·
The triple· headed monster felt thy charm,
And wagged his tail, and fawned, and licked thy
feet.
