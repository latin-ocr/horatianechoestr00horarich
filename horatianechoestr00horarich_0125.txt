To MAECENAS 9 3

But me the Muse cornmands, in dulcet lays

To sing your Queen Licymnia’s bright eyes shining
Into your own with intermingled rays,

And mutual fondness heart with heart entwining.

Quick at retort and jest, — she no less charms

When in the dance with graceful movement swaying‚
Than when on Dian's festal days her arms

Twine with the arms of brilliant maidens playing.

You would not give Licymnia's slightest tress
For all the gold that fertile Phrygia offers,
Nor all that Achaemenes' heirs possess,
Nor all the treasures in Arabian coffers.

When she With joy to hail your coming fiies,
Turning her neck to meet your fiery kisses‚
Eager to give, she oruelly denies, —
That you may seize‚ not she bestow, their blisseS.
