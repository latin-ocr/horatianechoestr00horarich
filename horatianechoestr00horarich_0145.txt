I. A CHORUS OF VIRGINS AND
YOUTHS

Odi profanum vulgus et arceo

HATE and banish hence the crowd profane3
Keep silenceg maids and boys, to you Ι sing.
The Muses' priest‚ I to their altar bring
Songs of a sacred and unwonted strain.

Monarchs their subject flocks in sear obey;
Jove, who on Titan foes in triumph trod,
Illustrious‚ moves all Nature with his nod,

And governs monarchs with imperia] sway.

One man plants larger vineyards than his brother3
Striving for votes, this in the Campus stands
And boasts a better fame ancl purer hands —

And this a nobler lineage —than another 3
