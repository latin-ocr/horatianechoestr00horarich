To MAECENAS 105

We wilt not part, — of hell’s worst brood defiant,
Despite Chimaera with her tongue of fire,

And Gyges too, the hundred-headed giant 3
I go where Justice and the Fates require.

Whether the Scales or Scorpion is ascendant,
Or Capricornus rules the Hesperian brine,
On the same horoscope our lives dependent,
My fortunes always have been linked with thine.

In strange accord our natal stars united,
For when malignant Saturn rnenaced thee,
Refulgent Jupiter thy pathway lighted
And saved thy lise for honors yet to be, —-

When at the theatre thy restoration

Was greeted by the crowd with three times three:
Mine was no less a cause of gratulation

That Faunus turned aside the falling tree —

Of witty men and wise the guardian, Faunus !

Bring forth thy victims, build thy votive shrine —
To keep our vows, ills thus averted warn us,

A lamb will answer well enough for mine.
