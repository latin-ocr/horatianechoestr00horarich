A PALJNODE 35

When Prometheus a man of a statue was making,
And compelled from all creatures to borrow a
part, —-
Last of all, when to life the cold marble awaking‚
The rage of the lion he lodged in his heart.

By anger Thyestes was doomed to perdition 3
Proud cities by anger have come to their fall 3
Walls and towers been razed with a fell demoliffion,

And the plough with its furrows has covered them
all.

Curb your temper3 the passion my warm heart in-
vited
Was laden with sweets in the flower of my days,
But the anger that glows in a love unrequited
Drove me wildly to pen my impetuous lays.

But Ι now would exchange the severe for the tender‚
And for all former sins make the amplest amends3
So Ι pray you accept the atonement Ι render,
And count me once more on the list of your friends.
