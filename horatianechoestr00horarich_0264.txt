PARAPHRASE OF
THE SECOND EPODE

Beatus ille, qui procul negotiis

[Mr. Sargent made humorous paraphrases of various odes,
adapted to special occasions. One only is here inserted, which
was written for a dinner of the Harvard Club in N ew York.]

ΟΗ, what a happy fellow he
Who lets no cares of business bore him,
But from bills, banks‚ and brokers free,
Lives as his father lived before him;
Contented‚ in his rural box,
To trim his trees, and fleece his flocks Ξ

He neither dreads the angry sea,

Nor fears the fireman-trumpet's call;
He fags not at the rnayor’s levee,

Nor haunts the Courts of City Hall;
Scouffing, as round his farm he trudges,
Injunctions from the Tammany judges.

Ere cherry blossoms deck the spray,
He sows his rye and ploughs for corn;
Superfluous branches lops away,
And grafts the Duchess on the thorn3
