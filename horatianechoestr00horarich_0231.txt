IX. TO LOLLIUS

[Vesorte credas interitura, qua>

HINK not the words will perish that Ι sing,
Born where the waters of Osanto roar 3
Words which, by poet’s art unknown before,
Set to the lyre are echoed from its string.

Maeonian Homer holds the upper seat,
But palms to Pindar we do not refuse 3
Nor to the Cean or Alcaeic muse,

Nor grave Stesichorus laudatiori meet.

Nor gay Anacreon’s songs of olden days
Has age destroyed 3 the words that love inspires
Outlive their utterance 3 and still live the fires
AEolian Sappho kindled in her lays.
