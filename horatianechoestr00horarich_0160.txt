128 THE ODES OF HORACE

Wisely the mind of Regulus foresaw‚
Rejecting base condimus, that the State
Would only rear a race degenerate‚

And ruin on the coming ages draw —

Unless our captive youth unpitied die.
“I saw,” he said, “the Roman ensign hung
In Punic temples 3 saw the weapons wrung
In bloodless battle from our soldiery,

“And Roman citizens with elbows bound
Behind their baeks 3 while so secure our foes,
Wide-open city gates they scorn to close,

The fields our arms laid waste With harvests crowned!

“ Ransomed by gold, forsooth, he will come back
A braver soldier! You but add a eost
To shame. The fleece that has its color lost
Dyed red, its pristine white will ever lack :

“In hearts of men degraded, to restore

Her former state true Valor does not care.

If the hind fights When resoued from the snare .
That man will be more daring than before
