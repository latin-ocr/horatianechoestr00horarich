VANJTY off RJCHES 107

And now for nothing more

Do I the Gods entreat‚ nor powerful friend
Beg to increase my store ;

With one small Sabine farm my wishes end.

Day chases after day,
And the new moons go on to wane and die 3
But as life slips away,
You, at death’s door, carved blocks of marble buy ς -

For you the shore lacks room,
You push the banks at Baiae on the wave ;
Regardless of your doom,
You build a palace‚ and forget your grave.

Nay more, incessantly

You raze the landmarks of your neighbors' grounds3
T hough they your clients be,

With greed insatiate you o'erleap their bounds.

In foreign climes to roam,

Their gods and children to their bosoms held,
From the ancestral home

The wretched wife and husband are expelled.
