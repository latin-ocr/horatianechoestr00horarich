To LYCE 141

But if neither gifts nor entreaties prevail,
And in spite of them all you will crue] remain,
If the cheeks of your lovers grow lividly pale,
And the singing girl meshes your husband in vain,

Spare your suppliant5‚ Lyce 3 corne down in your pride,
Be less hard than the oak and less cold than the
snake 3
Time will come, Ι ’11 not patiently lie on my side
On the sill in the hail and the rain for your sake.
