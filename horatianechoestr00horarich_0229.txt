TO CENSORJNUS 197

Songs you delight in. I can give you songs,
And fix the value of the thing I give :

To storied marble no such worth belongs,
In which the spirits of dead leaders live 3

For not the swift retreats of Hannibal, —

His threats flung back, —-— nor the avenging flame
That wasted Carthage‚ nor the exploits all

That gained victorious Scipio his name, —

Not these emblazoned such enduring praise,
The meed of worth and valor, as he found

When the Calabriam Muses tuned their lays
And uttered strains of no uncertain sound.

The laurel wreath would wither on your brow
Were deeds unwrit in story 3 what to us
Would be the son of Mars and Ilia now
If envious Silence obscured Romulus ἔ

AEaous, rescued from the Stygian wave,
Of virtue and the world's esteem possest,
The tongues of powerful bards avail to save
And place him in the islands of the blest.
