VI. TO APOLLO

Dive, quem proles lViobea magnae

OD ἔ whose stern might to avenge a scornful
boast
Slew N iobe's children, giant Tityus felled,
And Troy's assailant‚ almost conqueror, quelled —
Phthian Achilles — of the Grecian host

Greatest of all — yet not of thee the peer, —
Although, the son of ocean Thetis, he,
Expert in arms alike by land and sea,

Shook Dardan walls with his terrific spear.

As cypress torn up by an Eastern storm‚
Or pine—tree by the biting steel laid low,
Faus, far and wide its branches, even so
Fell prone in Teucrian dust his mighty form.
