To POLLIO 71

Your sage advice the Senate leans upon,
Sad clients on your powerful aid rely,

And triumphs, Pollio, in Dalmatia won,
Crowned you with laurel that shall never die.

Even now the brazen trumpets’ menacing crash
And the shrill clarion thrill my listening ear3
The riders' faces and the armor's flash
Inspire even now the flying steeds with sear.

In fancy, as you read, Ι hear the shout

Of mighty leaders soiled with battle's stains,
Not without honor: in the general rout

Cato's fierce sou] alone unbowed remains.

Juno ancl every friendly deity
Who §ought in vain the Africans to aid,
In vengeanoe‚ sent the vietors’ sons to die,
Unpitiecl victims to Jugurtha’s shade.

VVhere is the land but blood of Latius spilt

In impious wars its fertile acres feeds Ρ
Unnumbered sepulchres attest our guilt,

Sounds of Hesperia's downfall reach the Medes.
