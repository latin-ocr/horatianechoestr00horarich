XI. TO MERCURY

Mercuri, nam te docilis magistro

MERCURY, who taught so well
Amphion to move stones with song, ——
And thou, O seven-stringod shell,
The echoes of whose strains so long

Were mute and joyless‚ but which now

At sanes and rich men’s feasts we hear; —
In aptest measures tell me how

To reach obdurate Lyde’s ear.

She, like a filly young and free
Frisking and leaping in the fields,
Fearing a touch — her liberty
N either to spouse nor lover yields.
