IX. TO THALIARCHUS

mdes, ut alta stet nive candidum

O! looming through the frosty air,
Soracte's summit crowned with snow!
Woods labor with the load they bear,
And rivers, ice bound, cease to flow.

Come now, my genial host, with fire
And Sabine wine dispel this cold 3

Pile fagots in the chimney higher,
And tap a cask os four-year-old.

Leave to the Gods the rest, whose will
Subdues the tumult of the seas :

The waves subsffle, the winds are still,

Nor shake old ash and cypress trees.
