APPENDIX 22 Ι

that ‘doctus’ is an epithet so universally connected with
poets as to be peculiarly applicable and exclusively appli-
cable. In his very excellent dictionary of the Latin
tongue, which I have consulted in very numerous instances
with satisfaction, Professor Lewis falls into this familiar
mistake. In defining ‘doctus’ he gives as the meanings
by metonomy‚ — ‘Of things — learned, sage, skz'lful .-
frontes i. e. a poem, Horace, Book I. 1, 29.7 This is sim—
ply begging the question. ‘Id est’ suggests ‘est id?'
Why specially a poet's ? Where in Latin authors is the au-
thority for making ‘doctus ' a synonym for ‘poet'? We
know the epithet has been applied to Catullus (Tibullus,
ΙΙΙ. 6, 4Ι; also by Martial)‚ as it was applied to other
Romans who were familiar with the Greek language and
literature. So it was applied to Hesiod, who was a man
of extensive and varied learning. Catullus in repeated

, instances applies the word ‘docta' to some ‘puella' of

whom he was enamored. The Greek ‘sophos ’ was sorne-
times applied to poets‚ in the sense of ‘skilfuL’ So σοφὸς
ἀοιδός and Homer's ἐδίδαξε Μοῦσα.1

It has been objected that the expression ‘doctarum
frontium' could not properly be applied to Maecenas.
But the epithet ‘docte' is applied to Maecenas in the
eighth Ode of the third book (line 5), and in the nineteenth
Epistle of the first book (line 1). That in the same collec-
tion of poems to which the first Ode is introductory, Hor-
ace styles his patron ‘doctus—utriusque linguae‚’ abun-
, dantly justifies the application of the epithet to Maecenas
in that introduction itself. Even Mitscherlich, who con-
fines the application of the epithet to poets‚ says, ‘Adhaesit
hoc sequiori tempore poetis epitheton ob variam doctrinam,
