174 THE ODES OF HORACE

While she remains I praise her 3 when
She shakes her wings — no longer mine —-
I wrap me in my virtue then,
And all her many gifts resign —
And cast, though dowerless she be,
My lot with honest Poverty.

’T is not my fashion in the Sea
Encountering an Afric gale,

With creaking masas, —— on bended knee
In abjeci: sear to cower and quail,

And beg, with craven vows and prayers,

My Tyrian and Cyprian wares

May not enrich the greedy brine.

In keeping of my two-oared boat,
On me the Twins serenely smne,

The waves their burden kindly float,
And though the AEgean surges roar
Carry me safely to the shore.
