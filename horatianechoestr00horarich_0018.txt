viii INTRODUCTJON

always a favorite of the learned. The perfectiori ot
his style, the admirable truth and discrimination of
his critical judgment, the charming companionable
familiarity of his odes, the thoroughly human feeling
which pervades them, qualified by the sensitive fasti-
diousness inseparable from the highest cultivation, —
fit him for the scholar's intimate and the student’s
guide. Few could appreciate these excellences so
fully as Mr. Sargent. He assimilated all that was most
characteristic and captivating in this delicious writer,
whose fascination surpasses that of poets of far loftier
pretensionS. Virgil has been the object of an admira-
tion amounting almost to worship, but he will often
be found on the shelf, while Horace lies on the stu-
dent's table, next his hand. It is a privilege to be in-
troduced to the great Augustan lyrical poet and critic
by one so thoroughly conversant with his author, and
so deeply imbued with all the distinguishing qualities
of this refined, genial, clear-sighted, thoroughbred
Roman gentleman.

All Mr„ Sargent's translations bear the same mark
of fidelity to the original, and a happy transfusion of
ancient thought, which can never grow old, into ,the
modern phrases of another language.
