II. TO CRISPUS SALLUSTIUS

Nullus argento color est avaris

HE silver has no brightness which the mines
Hide in the greedy bosom of the earth3
And with thee, Sallust, ore has little worth,
Unless with wise and temperate use it shines.

So Proculeius, for a father's care
Bestowed upon his brethren, gained a name3
Him and his story shall surviving Fame

On tireless pinion through the ages bear.

A covetous spirit tame, and make thine own
A vvider realm than if all Libya
And far Hesperiam elimes confessed thy sway,
And either Carthage served but thee alone,
