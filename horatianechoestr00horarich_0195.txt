Youth’s tender minds have need
Of sterner studie53 our enervate race

No longer sit the steed
Or love the manly pleasures of the chase.

But, more expertly‚ they

Troll the (Ereek hoop, and with unlawful dice
At games of hazard play;

The sire, meanwhile, by fraudulent device

Robs co-heir‚ parmen friend,

For an unworthy son to >swell his store 3
But avariee in the end

Can only find enough —— in something more.
