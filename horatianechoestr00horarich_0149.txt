EDUCATJON 117

Sweet honor, for one's native land to die ἒ

Death follows on the adult coward's track‚

Nor spares the trembling limbs and crouching back
Of youth unwarlike that from battle fiy.

virtue —— that base repulse can never know,
Fulgent with honors incontaminate,
Lifts or lays down the fasces of the State,
And recks not how the winds of favor blow.

To men who merit immortality,
Virtue the gates celestia] opens wide,

Points out the way to vulgar crowds denied, —-
From the dull earth she spurns, alert to fly.

To faithful silence, too, its guerdon pay 1
I will not suffer him to share with me
House on the shore or pinnace on the sea,
Who could Love's sacred mysteries betray.

His laws neglected, Jove has ostentimes„
When with the sinful found, chastised the pure ;
And Vengeance, lame of foot, is slow, but sure
To catch the wicked running from his crimes.
