AUGUSTUS

N ext Romulus, or Numa's reign
Of peace, shall I commemorate?

Shall haughty Tarquin prompt the strain,
Or the last Cato's noble fate?

Regulus and the Scauri, men
Of the old stamp, next fire my lay,
Braves such as Carthage slaughtered when
Great Paullus threw his life away.

Fabricius, Curius unshorn,
Camillus, expert all in arms

For the state’s service, humbly born
To toil on their ancestral farms.

Marcellus’ glory, like a tree‚

Grows in the silent lapse of years 3
The Julian star resplendendy,

A moon mid lesser fires, appears.

Father and Keeper of mankind,

From Saturn sprung, —the Fates to thee
Care of great Caesar have assigned,

Thou, King, —and thy vice-gerent, he.
