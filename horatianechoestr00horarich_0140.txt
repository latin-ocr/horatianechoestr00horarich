108 THE ODES OF ΗΘΚΛ CE

Be sure, no gilded hall
More certainly its affluent lord awaits
Than one reserved for all,
Bounded by grasping Pluto's prison gates.

Why more ? Impartially

Doth Earth the dust of prinee and pauper hold,
Nor could Prometheus buy

Release from Charon with his wit and gold.

Proud Tantalus and all
His race in strietest durance he restrains ;
Called, or without a call,
He speeds the poor, absolved from all their pains.
