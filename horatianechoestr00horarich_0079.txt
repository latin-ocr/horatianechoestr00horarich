XXVI. TO LAMIA

[Musis amicus tristitimn el metus

FRIEND to the Muses, all tremors and tears
Ι fling to the winds of the Cretan sea5
What peril the king of the frozen North fears, -—
Who scares Tiridates, -is nothing to me.

And thou, gentle maid of the Pimplean spring,
Who in virgin and crystalline fountains rejoicest,
Come, and with thee be sure sunny flowers to bring,
And twine for my Lamia a wreath of the choicest.

To pay him due honors Ι cannot aspire,
But thou and thy sisters must blazon his fame,

And adding new chords to the Lesbian lyre
Awaken a symphony worthy his name.
