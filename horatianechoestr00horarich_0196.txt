XXVI. To VENUS

Vixi puellis nuper idoneus

LIVED for the girls and was true to their charms,
And Ι battled it not without glory3
But discharged from the war with my lute and my
arms,
This wall here shall rubrio my story :

It guards the left side of the Venus who rose
From the sea, so enchantingly gracious :

Here hang up your torches and crowbars and bows
To the doors shut against them minacious.

Holding 'Memphis the snowless and Cyprus thine isle,
Venus, goddess, accept the oblation ;
The most leal of thy subjects, queen, give me thy
smne,—
And proud Chlo‘e} -— a slight flagellation.
