A PPENDIX

Then with much dog he sallies forth
To hunt the woodcock and the quail,

Or capture, in unlawful snare,

Rabbit and squirrel unaware.

Arnid such joys of rural life,
What if his mistress fret and tease 1
If children bless him, and a wife,
Whose greatest pleasure is to please

(A wife stepped down from Plymouth Rock‚
Or scion of the old Dutch stock)‚

With big dry logs she builds the fire3
Expectant of her lord’s return,

She heaps the hickory high and higher,
And waits the hissing of the urm,

While from the meadows where they browse

PAT drives the solid-colored cows.

And now the evening meal is spread,
The unbought banquet of the farm, -—
Fruit marmalades‚ and sweet brown bread;
While the good housewife thinks no harrn
To give her home's 'coil-worn provider
A copious horn of this year's cider.

The oyster on the Eastern Shore

With Epicurean flavors smacks3
I 've supped at GUY’S in Baltimore

On devilled crabs and canvas—back5‚
And relished more than tongue can tell
Pheasant and Spanish mackerel.
