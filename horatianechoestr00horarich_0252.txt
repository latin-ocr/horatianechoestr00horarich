battle, —the honor of the triumph was represented by the
laurel. The horns of Bacchus were crowned with grape-
vines, his locks with ivy. Green youth and beauty were
garlanded with ivy. Horace tells Phyllis1 that there is
plenty of ivy in the garden, and that youth rej0ices in
the green ivy. He tells Julius F lorus2 that in eloquence‚
law, or poetry‚ he will win the victorious ivy. I think we
may safely say, then, that there is no ground whatever for
the assumption that the ivy was the peculiar crown of
poetry‚ any more than that Bacchus was the peculiar
patron of the poets. When Virgil awards the ivy as a
poetical reward,3 it is to the immature and rising,—the
nascent poets that he awards it,—not a ‘poet‚’ but growing
to be one. There is no instance in which the ivy is recog-
nized as distinctively a poetic crown. No reason can be
assigned why Horace should not have assigned that crown
to Maecenas as a man of learning, without reference to his
merits as a poet. Compare Pope's couplet—

Immortal Vida, on whose honored brow
The poet⁷s bays and critic’s ivy grow.

The ivy erowns of Bacchus were the meed of all learned
brows, and when Augustus formed the library in the tem-
ple οἱ Apollo on Mt. Palafflne, the statues of the famed
poets were crowned with ivy wreaths. Hence Persius, —-

Quorum imagines lambunt hederae sequaces,4
and Juvenal —

Ut dignus venias hederis, et imagine macra. 5
