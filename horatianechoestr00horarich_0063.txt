XV. THE PROPHECY OF NEREUS

Pastor cum traheret per freta navibus

HEN with Helen his hostess the treacherous
swam

On a vessel of Ida was scouring the main,
Nereus quelling the winds to an unwelcome rest

Thus sung their wild fates, with his vision opprest ε

“With ill omens, you bear to the home of your shame
The bride whom all Greece shall in battle reclaim,
Your infamous nuptials with ruin o’erwhelm,
And bring desolation on Priam’s old realm.

‘⁴ Alas for the riders! Alas for the steeds 1
Ι see Dardan graves, and a nation in weeds!
Now Pallas, irffuriate, drives to the field,
In her swift rolling chariot‚ with helmet and shielcl.
