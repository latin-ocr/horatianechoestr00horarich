XIX. TO BACCHUS

Bacchum in remotis carmina rupibus

ID the far rocks sat Bacchus, ‘reaching songs ε

Ι saw him —trust me, men of future years 1
A group of listening Nymphs about him throngs‚
And Satyrs=with goats’ feet and pointed ears.

The cry of Evoe! Evoe! fills the air —
My heart is trembling with a panio sear

And Bacchic rapture. Spare me, Liber, spare,
Thy frightful thyrsus turn aside and hear Ξ

Forgive 1 It is my province now to sing
The revels of the frenzied Thyiades -
The copious streams of milk, -— and earth's wine-
spring,
And honey dropped from hollow trunks of trees.
