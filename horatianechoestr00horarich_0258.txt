226 APPENDJX

For you the blooming ivy grows
Proud to adorn your learned brows.
Patron of letters you arise,

Grow to a God and mount the skies.
Humbly in breezy shades Ι stray, etc.

Also Dr. VVatson's edition, 1741.

The edition 01 Sanadon published at Amsterdam and
Leipsic‚ 1756, has ‘ te.' It says, ‘Rutgers a propose' cette
16ςο11, qui est excellente'—‘Cette correction est neces-
saire’——-‘Maecenas tenoit un rang distingue sur 16 Ρ31-
113556, non-seulement par les Ρο65165, 111315 311551 parce qu'il
61311601111116 16 juge du 11161116 Poetique et la dispensation
des recompenses)

Daru (1816), and Louis Duchemin‚ F rench translators
(1116 131161 1846), adopt ‘te.' ‘If Me has 1116 authority of
the MSS. the Te accords infinitely better with the 56-
quence of ideas and with the delicacy 01 Horace. After
ranking himself with the gods, it is not natural that 116
should claim 3 111616 separation from the vulgar and pre-
tend to 110 111016 glory than he derived from the suffrage 01
1115 benefactor. Maecenas was himself 3 111311 01 1611615,
11311 composed works in prose and verse, and on those
grounds alone could claim 1116 ivy crown. Horace could
1101 110 1655 111311 pay him the compliment. It is perfectly in
the spirit of 3 dedication. We do not correct Horace ; we
only restore him.' [R. Binet (1783), quoted by Duchemin.]

Tomaso Gargallo‚ who published an Italian translation at
N aples in 1 820, 111 10111 volumes, since several times reprinted
in smaller form, uses ‘ te.’ See the Polyglott Horace.

F. A. Wolf (1817), ‘Analecta Literaria‚’ vol. i. pp. 261-
276‚ and ii. pp. 282, 283, 566-571‚ favors the emendation.
