VII. TO POMPEIUS VARUS

O soepe mecum tempus 2‘72 ultimum

EAREST companion of my prime,
Who under Brutus shared with me
The dangers of that troubles] time -—
Who, Pompey, has restored to thee
The civil rights that Romans prize,
Thy fathers’ gods, Italian skies ?

But not in feats of arms alone
Were all our hours of youth consumed ,-
For, crowned with fiowers, my ringlets shone,
By Syrian essences perspmed,
When thou and I on many a day
With wine drove loitering Time away.

Ι saw with thee Philippi’s field,

The onset and the headlong ssight:
