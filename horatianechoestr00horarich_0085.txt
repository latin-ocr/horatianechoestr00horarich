XXX. TO VENUS

O Venus, regina Cnidi Paphique

VENUS, of Cnidos and Paphos the queen,

In your well beloved Cyprus no longer be seen 3
But listen, I pray, to my Glycera's call,
And breathe the frankincense that burns in her

hall.

Let Cupid come with you, impetuous boy,
And the Graces with girdles loosed add to your joy 3
Let the Nymphs corne, and silver-tongued Mercury

too,
And Youth â€”void of beauty or charm without you.
