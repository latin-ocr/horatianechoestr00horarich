V. LALAGE

Nondum subacta ferrejugum valet

HE is like a young heifer— it never will do
To couple this delicate creature with you3
The yoke does not suit her— she never will pull

Her part in the load with a fiery bull.

For your heifer now little or nothing heeds

But to plash in the waters and graze on the meads,
And to frisk with the calves on the river's bank
Where the shade of the willows is cool and dank.

Then why will you follow this bootless suit
And the fancy you have for an immature fruit?
To pluck the blue clusters be never in haste, —
Rich Autumn will purple the grape to your taste.
