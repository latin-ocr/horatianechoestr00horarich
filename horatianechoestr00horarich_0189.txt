TO TELEPHUS 157

Thrice three for the uneven tale of the Muses
The bard who is fond of them never refuses,
But the Grace and her sisters, undraped though
they be,
For fear of a quarrel forbid more than three.

We are in for a frolic shall last the whole night,
Now and then to be mad is to me a delight3
The pipe of Cybele, O, why is it mute?
And why hang in silence the lyre and flute?

N iggard hearts I detest, — scatter roses, my boys,

Sing and shout till old Lycus shall envy our noise 3
And the neighbor he covets for better or worse 3——
It is not a sweetheart he needs, but a nurse.

Thee, Telephus, bright with thy thick flowing hair,

Who well may with Vesper in beauty compare, ——
Thee, Rhode, a maid ripe and rosy, admires, —
While Ι arn consumed by my Glycera's fires.
