APPENDJX 21 7

But it may be said, perhaps it has been said, that there
is a complimentary reference to Maecenas in the last two
lines, where the poet attributes such virtue and value to
his verdict on the lyric merits of Horace. But such refer-
ence without something in the Ode to indicate on what it
was founded amounts to nothing. Why was the opinion
of Maecenas of so much weight? Because he was a scion
of old kings, or because he was the patron of the poet?
Maecenas did not care a straw for his descent, and if any
compliment is contained in the second line it was as much
a compliment to the merits of the author as to the discern-
ment of the critic. In this complimentary Ode, then, there
is no compliment to MaecenaS, unless he is the person
alluded to as the wearer of the ivies.

This difficulty has always been felt by the commenta-
tors, who have in vain endeavored to explain it away.
Bonfini, who printed his commentaries in Rome as early
as 1519, says that different people may make of this pas-
sage what they please: ‘I think, indeed,' he adds, ‘that
nothing was farther from Horace’s thoughts than to claim
for himself divine honors, and to mix himself with the gods,
and especially in his very first Ode to subject himself to
the charge of arrogance, not to say foolhardiness and in-
solence‚ It is usual for persons who have an excessive
desire for anything to indulge in that manner of speech, -
as if a young man who was immoderately fond of his mis-
tress should say, “ If Ι should possess my mistress I am
blessed‚''—not because he would be blessed in reality,
but because he might seem blessed to himself.’ This is
certainly not a satisfactory rebuttal of the charge the com-
mentators would formulate in the absence of this explana-
tion. Now what is the distinct averment in the passage?
