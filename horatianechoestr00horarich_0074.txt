XXII. TO FUSCUS

hzteger vitae scelerisque purus

HE pure of hand and whole of heart‚
My Fuscus, needs no other arm,

No practice in the bowman's art,
No venomed shafts‚ no Moorish dart,
To keep him safe from harm, --

Whether through Syrtes’ glowing sands
His journey lies, through boiling waves,

Or Caucasus’ bleak table-lands

Inhospitable‚ or the golden strands
Fabled Hydaspes laves. n

In Sabine woods, without a care,
And singing lays to Lalage,
I Strayed beyond my bomwds, and there
A wolf was startled in his lair
And ran away from me.
