XIV. TO THE STATE

O navi5‚ referent in mare te novi

ARQUE, where do the new billows bear thee ?
About! and into harbor sail.
Sides stripped of oars but ill prepare thee
To face the terrors of the gale.

By Afric Winds thy mast is broken 3

Thy main-yards groan ς and, lacking ropes,
In vain thy keel, all signs betoken‚

With too imperious surges copes.

No Gods to hear thy supplication‚
No sails without a rent are thine3
An empty boast thy name and nati0n‚
Though fashioned of the Pontic pine,

29.
