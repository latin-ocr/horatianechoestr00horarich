ΙΙΙ. ΤΟ THE SHIP IN WHICH VIRGIL
SAILED TO ATHENS

Sic te diva potens Cypri

O may thy course the queen of Cyprus guido,
So Helena's twin brethren light thy sails,
And AEolus restrain all winds beside
The North-west sweeping in propitious gale53

That thou, O ship‚ I earnestly implore,

Mayst guard the precious freightage in thy care,
And through the billows to the Attio shore,

virgil, my soul’s own half, in safety bear.

For surely mail of oak and triple brass
Encased the breast of him who dared the first

In a frail bark the savage sea to pass,

And dauntless faced the Afric winds that burst
