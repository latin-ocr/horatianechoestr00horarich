182 THE ODES OF HORA CE

Ten bullocks and as many cows
For you must on the altar bleed3
A little calf will pay my vows,
That frisks new-weaned upon the mead 3

The crescent that adorus his head

Like the moon's thirdâ€”day fires is bright 3
His color is a tawny red,

But where he 's marked the spots are white.
