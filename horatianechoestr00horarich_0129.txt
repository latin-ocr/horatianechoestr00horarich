XIV. TO POSTUMUS

Elzezc fugaces, Postume, Postume

Y Postumus, the fleeting years
Pass swiftly. N either prayers nor tears
Can smooth the lines by age imprest
Or Death's advancing step arrest, —

Not if three hundred bulls a day

You should to tearless Pluto slay,
Whose Stygiam waters' circling chain
The Giants strive to break in vain, -

Waters that all of mortal birth

Must cross who eat the fruits of Earth,
Whether they bask in wealth‚ or toil
To win scant fare from stubborn soil.
