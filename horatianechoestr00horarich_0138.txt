XVIII. VANITY OF RICHES

lVon ebur neque aureum

O ivory or gold
In my abode on fretted ceilings gleam83
Numidiam marbles hold
On lofty columns no Hymettian beams.

Not as an unknown heir
Do I the wealth of Attalus assume3

Nor splendid purples wear
That noble clients weave in Spartan loom.

But plain integrity
Is mine, and talentâ€˜of a liberal vein 3

And humble though I be

The wealthy seek me and my friends remain.
