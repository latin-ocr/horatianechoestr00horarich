A friend writes: “Mr. Sargent’s manner of life
seems to have been in many respects what Horace
himself regarded most pleasant. He had his house
in town, and he had a charming country-seat3 he saw
much of the world, and he loved it,· he loved his
friends, and he loved to have them about him ,- his
intellectual life extended to his death,—his studies
were pursued to the very last, and in his beloved
Horace he found delight, solace, peace, refreshment
at all times. In one of the last letters he wrote, he
referred to a book of translations which I had men-
tioned, saying that law business had prevented him
for six months from keeping run of the new pub-
lications. ‘Hence,’ he wrote, ‘within sight of port,
having only three odes' distance before me, Ι have
been obliged to abandon Horace for the present.' ''

He did not live to resume the work 3 and, in all, six
odes appear to have been untouched by him, while of
the others more than that number were left incomplete,
and have therefore been omitted from this volume.

He died of bronchial pneumonia, after an illness of
two weeks, on December 28, 1891, in New York. He
was buried from St. Paul's Church, Boston, and was
laid beside his wife in Mount Auburn.
