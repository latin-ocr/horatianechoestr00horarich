Vn. TO TORQUATUS

Dg'fficgere nives, redemztjam gramina campis

HE snows have fied 3 new foliage clothes the
woods 3 ‚
Again the grasses make the meadows green 3
The seasons change 3 and with Subsiding floods
The tranquil rivers flow their banks between ε

In merry dances dares, unclad, the Creme,

With her twin sisters and the Nymphs‚ to play.
With no immortal hope beguiles our race

The year, the hour, that steals the genia] day.

The Zephyrs melt the eold 3 the Summer treads —
Herself too soon to perish — on the Spring 3
His fruits the apple-bearing Autumn sheds3
And inert Winter shortly rounds the ring.
