tion of Baxter’s Horace, inserted ‘te’ in eight copies. In
1727 Welsted adopted it.

In Bower’s ‘Historia Literaria,' 1731, mention is made
of a new discovery ‘lately communicated to us abroad by
a very learned critic,' but at page 235 concludes, ‘This
emendation is not quite new—the reader will find some
hints of it in Janus Rutgersius.'

An extended discussion of the whole passage is to be
found in the ‘Jahrbiicher fiir Philologie und P'adagogik,'
ΙΙ. 3, pp. 282-294 (1827), by J. C. Jahn, in a review of the
works of T. Kiessling and A. F. W. Leiste. Jahn gives
the following account of the origin and reception of the
conjecture. ‘Rarely has a conjecture produced such a
sensation as the substitution of that Te for Me. Rutger-
sius, Hare, Des F ontaines, and whoever else had a share in
the suggestion, hardly dreamed that they would stir up so
much strife. And after what Cunningham, Dacier‚ Gesner,
Klotz, and others had adduced to the contrary, it would
all have been forgotten, if Wakefield and Fea, following
Broukhusius, Jones, and Markland, had not called it to
life again, and Fr. Aug. Wolf, especially, established it
on intelligent grounds. Such a leader must indeed find
followers, and who can wonder that Eichst'adt, Grobel,
Wagner, and others, and at last even Stadelmann, sought
to further establish it? That also Jack and the Tauchnitz
edition took it into the text happened not from their own
conviction, but because they followed Fea.’

In 1736 Signor Palavicini admits it in an Italian trans-
lation. Rev. John Jones, 1736, inserts it. He says ‘me’
destroys the sense, or weakens it very much. Dr. Wm.
Broome, employed by Pope in his translating of the Iliad,
adopted it in 1739: ——
