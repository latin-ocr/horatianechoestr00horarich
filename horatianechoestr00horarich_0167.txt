ΤΟ ASTERJE

He tells what came in older times
From slight of a perfidious wife3

How Proetus' saith in {abled crimes
Cost cold Bellerophon his life.

He tells how nearly blood was spilt‚
When Peleus shunned Hippolyte3
With lessons of historic guilt‚
That teach such things again may be.

In vain. To voices such as these,

He 's deas as Icarus' rocks. But thou!—
Beware —lest Enipeus please

More than behoves a neighbor now :

Though none with equal mastery

His courser through the Campus guides 3
Nor any swirnmer swift as he

May wrestle with the Tuscan tides.

Thine house at evening twilight close 3
Nor stir abroad 3 nor heed the strain,

With musio mixed, that sings his woes3
He calls thee prude, ——a prude remain Ξ
