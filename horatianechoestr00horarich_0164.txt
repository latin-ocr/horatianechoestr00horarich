132 TJJE ODES OF HORACE

Of Rome how imminent the overthrow 1
By feud and faction torn, and doomed to meet
The double terrors of the AEthiop fleet‚

And arrows hurtling from the Dacian bow.

Fertile in crime, the age dishonored first
The vows of marriage, homes, and families‚ —-
Exhaustless spring of all calamities

Which on the people and the country burst.

To wanton measures in the Ionian dance
The ripened virgin dearly loves to whirl‚
Expert in amorous arts 3 the budding girl

On stripling sweethearts casts no furtive glauce.

Ere long she fiirts with many a younger spark
At her lord's table, while he quaffs his wine, —
And recks not whether choice or chance assign
To whom she gives her kisses in the dark 3

But with her conscious husband’s eye upon her,
Rises obedient to the broker⁷s beck
Or the rich captain of some Spanish deck‚ >
Who brings the costly wage of their dishonor,
