XXXVI. TO NUMIDA
Et thure et fidibus juvat

OME, strike the lyre, and incense burn,
And be the votive heifer Smin,
To thank for Numida’s return
The Gods who bring him home again, -—-

Who from Hesperia’s fartheSt shore
Meets friends not met for many a year,
To all some kisses gives, but more
To Lamia, dearest of the dear, —

Mindful that they in school-boy days
Watched the same master's smile or frown,
Together shared their tasks and plays,

Together donned the manly gown.
