TO VENUS

For he, a man of noble parts,
His voice in elients’ causes tried,
Equipped with countless elever arts‚
Shall bear* thy standard far and wide.

When, with a victor’s scorn, at gold

By a rich rival showered‚ he smiles, -
A fane with citron roof shall hold

Thy marble form in Alban isleS.

There clouds of incense shall ascend, -
And Berecynthiam pipe and Inte,

That with the songs their music blend‚
Shall charm thee, not without the flute.

There to thy honor twice a day

Shall boys and maidens dance a round3

Their white feet in the Saliam way

With triple beat shall shake the ground.

Nor woman’s love, nor youth’s is mine,
Nor hope a mutual heart to find;
1 joy no more in bouts of wine,

Nor with fresh flowers my temples bind.
