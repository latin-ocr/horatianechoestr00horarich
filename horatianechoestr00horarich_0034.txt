THE ODES Ol* H OA’A CE

No gold will tempt on Cyprian prow
To face Myrtoan storms and breakers.
The merchant, fearing winds and waves,
Praises farm-life and quits the sea,
But soon again its shipwreeks braves,
Untaught to bear with poverty.
This man disdains not to recline
Beneath an arbute half the day,
And quaff his cups of Massic wine,
And doze where sacred fountains play.
Live many men for whom the camp
And trumpet-blast that calls to arms,
The horn's Sbarp shriek‚ and war’s stern tramp‚
Hated by mothers, have their charms.
Unmindful of his tendet sponse,
The huntsman fronts the frosty air,
If faithful hounds the deer arouse,
Or wild boar break the well-wrought snare.
Thee‚ ivies‚ crown of learned men,
Mix with celestia] gods3 with me,
Apart from eron-ds, in grove and glen
Satyrs and Nymphs find company—
If sweet Euterpe plays her flute‚
Nor Polyhymnia denies
Her echoes of the Lesbian lutet
But Ι shall touch the starry skies
If thou vouehsafe to write my name
Among the bards of lyric fame.
