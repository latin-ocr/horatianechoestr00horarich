28 THE ODES OF HORA CE

Listen to me, and I 'm sure you '11 think
There 's little to hope from a lover so rude

As to mar your charms in his greed to drink
The kisses with Venus’ own nectar imbued.

Thrice happy and more than thrice happy are they
Who live unmoved by this passionate sfflfe,
United more closely as years wear away, —-
The end of their love is the end of their life.
