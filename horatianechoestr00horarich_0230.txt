198 THE ODES OF HORACE

The Muse bids live the man deserving praise‚
And him in Heaven the muse beatifies 3

Thus Hercules, renowned for toilsome days,
At Jupiter's much-envied banquets lies;

Thus the twin stars, the sons of Tyndarus,
From the sea's depths snatch vessels tempest-
wrecked 3
The vows of men to good conclusions thus

Bacchus conducts‚—-his brows with vine-leaves
decked.
