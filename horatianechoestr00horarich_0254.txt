‘ Dis miscent superis ' the editor just cited compares with
an expression of Pindar,1 who uses it not of any degree of
deification, but of gaining prizes in the games. Dacier‚
1689, and also Duneombe, 17 57, say that Horace intended
by ‘Dis miscent’ simply ‘render me happy‚’ for other-
wise there is a manifest contradiction in the sequel when
he says that the sus-frage of Maecenas raises him above the
skies. Duncombe allows that the conjecture is ingenious,
and the opposition not inelegant, ‘or perhaps Horace was
jocularly expressing his high opinion of Poesy—“rallies
himself.’' If we suppose it means that Maecenas values
himself as an equal of the gods for his poetry, —it is an odd
compliment3 while if we suppose Horace is speaking his
own sentiment, — he departs from the scheme of the Ode
merely to introduce a compliment to his patron.' But
what is the scope and object of a dedication if not to com-
pliment?

Vanderbourg says that all the interpreters agree in re-
garding Ode 1 as the prologue or dedication to Maecenas
of the first book Horace published. The scope of the
poem he thus expresses: ‘Chacun a son penchant qui le
domine. Moi, je mets ma gloire et mon bonheur a re'usser
dans la poe'sie lyrique: si tu m’accorde ton suffrage‚ Mae-
cenas, je croirai m’e'lever aux cieux.’ Vanderbourg feels

gaining Olympic prizes;—lit. ‘were mingled with immortals.'
