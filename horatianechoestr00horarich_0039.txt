In sudden blast -— contending with the North —-
Nor feared the rain-foreboding Hyades,

Nor the South wind that rushes madly forth,
The master of the Adriatic seas.

What form of death feared he who with dry eyes
Looked on the swimming monsters of the deep,
Who saw in rage the ocean billows rise‚
And the ill-iamed Acroceraunian steep Ξ

The several nations of the earth to part
Hath a wise Providence essayed in vain,
If by contrivances of human art
We leap the barriers of the unsocial main.

But the forbidden, mortals most desire,
By man are all things dared and all things wrought3
Stolen by audacious craft, celestial fire
Was by Prometheus to the nations brought.

With fire carne new diseases upon man,
Now, first, consumption — wasting fevers came 3
Of human years grim Death curtailed the span,
Hastening his step and taking surer aim.
