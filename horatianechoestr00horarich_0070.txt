XIX. GLYCERA

Mater soeva Cupidinum

RUEL mother of Cupids, why make this attack‚ ——
With the plump son of Semele close at your
back ?
Why come again thus, with Desire in your train,
And kindle love's sparks in its ashes again?

Pure as Parian marble is, chiselled by art,

The strange beauty of Glycera fires my heart,
With the mock on her lips and the flash of her een

And the face never still long enough to be seen.

Venus rushing with all her force madly at me,
The temples deserts in her isle of the sea 3
And forbids me of Scythian invaders to sing,
Or of Parthian riders who shoot on the wing, ⁴
