XXIII. TO PHIDYLE

Caelo supinas si tuleris manus

HY palms to heaven in prayer and praise,
Lift up, my rustic Phidyle,
With every new moon’s earliest rays 3

Shall blight the harvest of thy fields ;

The clusters that thy vineyard yields ;
Nor need thy tender nurslings sear
The deadly Autumn of the year.

Or browsing Alba’s grassy plain,
