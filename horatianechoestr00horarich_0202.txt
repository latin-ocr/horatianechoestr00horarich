XXIX. TO MAECENAS
Tyrrhena regum p7‘0genieS‚ tibi

F Tuscan kings the progeny,
An unbroached cask of mellow wine,
Maecenas, I 've reserved for thee,
With roses round thy brow to twine‚
And from the balsam pressed with care
The choicest persumes for thy hair ——

All ready. Come without delay‚

Nor always muse in waking dreams
Over the slopes of AEsula‚

And Tibur with its many streams,
And cliffs where memories still abide
Of Telegon the parricide.

Fly from the affiuence that palls

With its fastidious luxury3
