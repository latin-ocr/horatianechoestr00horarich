XVI. TO GROSPHUS

Otium divos rogat z'n patenti

EST! prays the mariner, by storm
Caught in the wide AEgaean sea —
When blaekening clouds the skies deform
And lone stass glimmer fitfully.

For rest the furious Thracians cry,
The quivered Parthians pray for rest 3
Rest‚ Grosphus, neither gold can buy
Nor precious stones nor purple vest.

In vain your treasures you display
Or lictor⁷s summonses to quit —
The cares and tumults still will stay

That round the gilded eeilings flit.
