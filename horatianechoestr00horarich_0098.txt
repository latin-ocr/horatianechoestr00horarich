THE ODES OF HORACE

Nor suffer this propitious day
Its mark of Cretan white to lack,
Nor whirl of Salian dances stay,
Nor spare the fiagons on the rack,

Nor in his bout with Damalis
Let Bassus at her bumpers quail,
Nor let our banquet roses lack,
Nor parsley green, nor lily frail.

On Damalis they all shall gaze
With meltlng eyes Í¾ but like a vine
Shall Damalis in wanton ways
About her new-found lover twine.
