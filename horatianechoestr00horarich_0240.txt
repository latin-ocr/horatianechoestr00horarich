XIV. TO AUGUSTUS

Quae cura patrum quoeve Quiritium

HAT popular or what patrician care,
By carved inscriptions and memorial pages,
shall to the nafions, through perpetual ages,
Thy name, Augustus, and thy virtues bear?

Greatest of princes thou, where'er the sun

On habitable regions sheds a ray,

Whom tribes that never knew the Latin sway
Know by late deeds of war so bravely done :

For gallant Drusus, with thy soldiery,
Razed castles on tremendous Alpine heights,
And routed more than once in bloody fights Î¹
