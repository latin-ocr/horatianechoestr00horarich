IV. TO LUCIUS SESTIUS

Solvitur acris hiems

ARD Winter melts 3 the welcome Spring again
Comes back, and in her train

The West wind, and the laid-up keels once more
Are launched from the dry shore.

No longer do the herds the stans desire
Nor husbandman his fire3

The meadows that but now were white with frost
Their pallid hues have lost.

In clance, by Cytherean Venus led,
With the moon overhead‚

Joined with the Nymphs the sister Graces beat
The earth with rhythmic feet,

While at the Cyelops’ ponderous forge the light
Makes swarthy Vulcan bright.

Now round the tresses that with unguents shine
Green myrtles we may umine,

Or flowers with which from icy setters freed
Earth garnishes the mead.
