XXIV. CUPIDITY

Intactis opulentior

ITH larger wealth endowed
Than virgin India or rich Araby,
Though thy foundations crowd
Alike the Tuscan and Apulian sea 3

If in thy roos-tree F ate,

Ruthless, has driven her adamantine nails,
Thy head to extricate

From fears or snares of Death no gold avails.

The Scythians live better,
Who carry round their homesteads in their carts 3
No formal customs setter

The hardy Getae, no corrupting arts.
