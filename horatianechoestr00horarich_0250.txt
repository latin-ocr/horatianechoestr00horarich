21 8 APPENDJX

It is that some one by virtue of the ivies which are the
reward of learned men mixes with the gods. We have
seen why the some one should not be Horace, but Horace
it was held to be, —with mitigation and apology and ex-
planation,—from the first inception of the blunder down '
to the first quarter of the eighteenth century.

I have no great fondness for the discussion of various
readings. I fully concur with Hallam in the opinion that
‘those who annex an exaggerated value to correcting an
unimportant passage in an ancient author, or, which is
much the same, interpreting some worthless inscription,
can hardly escape the imputation of pedantry.’ But this
is not an unimportant passage. It is by far the most im-
portant correction that has ever been made in the text of
Horace. All the early MSS. without exception repeat the
blunder of the copyist who first made it. All the printed
copies, without exception, from the first without date down
to the year 1721, confirm the error. The latest and most
esteemed English editors, —Valpy, Wickham, Page, Mil-
man‚ Macleane, Yonge, Long, Munro, and the' rest of
them, —-have pinned their saith on Orelli, and readopted
the text of the old manuscripts. ‘Me’ seems to be rein—
stated by Horatian commentators‚ and yet it is capable of
demonstration that the reading is erroneous, and so clearly
erroneous as to be incapable of intelligent vindication.

The correction is purely conjectural, and we are just on
the threshold of our study, with the inquiry whether or not
a merely conjectural emendation is ever justifiable. The
answer to this is that all the commentators frequently
accept readings purely conjectural. Of the emendations
of Horace proposed by Bentley, no less than one hundred
and fifty-two were conjectural, and Bentley is lauded to
