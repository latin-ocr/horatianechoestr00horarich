1 84 THE ΘΒΜ OF ΗΘΚΛ CE

And none with jealous eye regards

My place of honor with the bards.
And thou, O Muse, who rulest well

The sweet sounds of the golden Shell,
And to mute fishes of the sea

Canst give the cygnet's melody,
To thee alone is due that I

Am marked of all the passers—by
As minstrel of the Roman lyre, —

Thy gifts alone my song inspire 3
And if I please‚ the praise is thine,

Sweet lyrist of the sacred N ine.
