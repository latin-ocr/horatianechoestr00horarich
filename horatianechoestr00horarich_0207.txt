XXX. TO MELPOMENE

Exegi monumentum aere perennius

MONUMENT more durable than brass —
Of height no regal pyramids surpass,
I have achieved a work that will outlast
The waste of waters or the northern blast.
I shall not wholly die, but much of me,
My better part, shall reach posterity.
No ssight of seasons shall obscure my name,
But serial ages shall increase my fame.
While to the Capitol, to Time's last day,
Pontiff and vestal tread the sacred way,
lt shall be told of one of humble birth,
Now potent with the magnates of the earth, —-
Bred where he heard Osanto’s torrent roar,
When Daunus' subjects ploughed its arid shore, -ι
That he first wed— to him that praise belongs —-
AEolian measures to Italian songs.
With guerdon crown desert, Melpomene,
And give the Delphic laurel wreath to me.
