Thy palace with the lofty walls

171

That cleave the clouds and near the sky, —

Escaping in my humble home
The smoke and wealth and noise of Rome.

Changes are grateful to the rich,
And ostentimes a neat repast
Is spread at poor men’s tables which
By lavish wealth is unsurpassed.
Feasts without purple hangings there
Have smoothed the ruffled brow of care.

The father of Andromeda
Reveals his lately hidden fire 3
Now Procyon sheds a fiereer ray,
Precursor of the dog-star⁷s ire —
And with the rampant Lion's blaze
The summer sun brings seorching days.

Now, watchful of his drooping floek,
The wearied shepherd seeks the shades,
The running stream and sheltering roek
In rough Silvanus' briery glades,
But on the river-bank no air
Invades the silence slumbering there.
