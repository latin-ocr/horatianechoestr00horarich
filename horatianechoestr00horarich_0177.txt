XIII. TO THE FOUNTAIN OF
BANDUSIA

Ofens Bandusioe splendidior vitro

CRYSTAL Bandusffl, fountain of ours,v
Worthy of sweet wine and not without flowers,
On ‘chine altar to-morrow
A kid comes to sorrow.

Buds os: young horns on his forehead are swelling‚
Proudly of, love and love’s battle‘s foretelling‚

But his hopes are all vain,
Thee his red blood shall stain.

No rage of the dogstar thy freshness invades,
Steers tired of the plough seek repose in thy shades‚
Straying flocks at thy brink
Of the cold waters drink.
